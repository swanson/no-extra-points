The weekly **_RB Platoon Report_** series goes beyond the boxscores and tries to decipher the backfield situation for every Alliance team. With many teams employing a committee approach, identifying the valuable contributors at the RB position could make or break your fantasy week.

_Note: all snap count and routes run data comes from game film analysis and is unofficial._

## Arizona Hotshots

**Bellcow: Jhurell Pressley**

Whew, I was getting scared on Saturday that we would not have any bell cow running backs. Pressley was the second bellcow to merge and the more efficient of the two. His third down snap percentage highlights that Arizona is not afraid to keep him in. Early indication is that he is their go-to pass catching back. He was the only back to get a target and he was even subbed in on two seperate third and long situations.

There doesn’t seem to be a fixed pattern in the red zone as whoever is in on the drive typically stays in. As long as that touch percentage and snap count stays up in the 50-60s count Pressley in as an elite RB1 going forward.

**Backup: Larry Rose**

Rose is just your prototypical backup and won’t have that much enticing value without an injury. It is interesting that he garnered 4 redzone snaps and a carry on a 2pt attempt, although that mainly came when Pressley needed rest. The Hotshot’s high-scoring offense is the only thing keeping him somewhat playable.

**Backup: Justin Stockton**

Very similar to usage to Rose, but Stockton was a lot more efficient. Although a lot of his snaps came in the 4th quarter when the game was basically won, he did technically outsnap Rose. Did not see much 3rd Down/Redzone work but his talent mixed with this high scoring offense should keep him in the FLEX conversation in some deeper leagues.

## Orlando Apollos

**Lead Back: Akeem Hunt**

Akeem Hunt gets the designation of lead back as he comfortably led the Apollos in touches and snapshare. Hunt was the most involved back on third down but did have some drops that led to others getting more 3rd down use as the game went on. The Apollos rotated RBs every series so it was basically luck of the draw who got these RZ touches so I will not read into it to much, although it is comforting to know that Hunt saw 7 RZ snaps and 5 GL/2pt snaps.

A little more efficiency and usage in the passing game and we are talking about an aspiring bell cow. Buy low on Akeem Hunt.

**Grinder : De’Veon Smith**

Smith gets the designation of grinder because he is the biggest back on the team and scored a close TD and 2pt conversion. Not necessarily a goal line back because Hunt saw a lot of action down there but he is still the closest thing this team has to a grinder. If he continues this usage at the goalline and a 25% touch share he will be a RB3 with weekly upside on this offense.

**Backup: D’Ernest Johnson**

Not a super small back but he is very fast. Looked very electric and was efficient on his limited carries. Lots of people saw the highlights of his long TD split out wide and that was definitely an impressive showcase of his receiving skills. Still being his only target, hard to call him anything more then a backup and RB3 unless there is an injury or increased role for Johnson.

## Birmingham Iron

**Bellcow: Trent Richardson**

Oh boy. This is the AAFs most heavily used RB making him a definite bellcow. The 2 TDs and 2pt speak for themselves, but what is more impressive is the fact that he had 9 redzone snaps and 7 touches. Also, 5 GL/2pt snaps and all 5 were touches. Birmingham seem committed to using Richardson in the redzone.

Usually, Richardson’s name isn’t synonymous with “pass-catcher” but he ran 17 routes and brought in a screen pass where he made a few people miss. The 17 routes ran to lead to a few more catches and an even better baseline for this elite RB1.

**3rd Down Back: LaDarius Perkins**

Perkins is the clear-cut 3rd down back as he caught 6 passes on 8 targets and ran 16 routes on only 23 snaps. Had 5 touches on third downs which was more than Richardson and he even got some work in the redzone. While he did not provide much through the air and probably won’t score TDs with Richardson there, he holds RB2 value as one of the AAF’s premiere pass catchers, especially in PPR scoring formats.

## San Antonio Commanders

**Lead Back: Kenneth Farrow**

Farrow got a lot of work and posted a league-high 12 third down snaps but his efficiency was poor. While he did have 12 3rd Down snaps, he failed to record even 1 target. He didn’t necessarily blow out the other backs in RZ snaps but 6 snaps is not a number to scoff at. The TD was nice but in order for Farrow to continue as an RB1 he needs to up the efficiency and hopefully draw some targets.

**Change of Pace: Aaron Green**

Green looked very impressive on tape but 7 touches are a little worrisome in a crowded backfield. Only ran 7 routes and brought in just a short swing pass so the receiving numbers don’t make up for the lack of carries. No matter how good he looked on tape, his snap and touch shares must go up for him to be worthy of RB2 consideration.

**Backup: David Cobb**

Off the bat, Cobb looks really big and more nimble than I expected. Nine carries is a pretty good number as well but the snap percentage is a little low. Got a little work in the passing game but I don’t expect that to stick too much. Whoever emerges out of Cobb and Green will push for RB2 potential, but as of now he is a RB3 in a crowded backfield.

## Salt Lake Stallions

**Lead Back: Joel Bouagnon**

While he did not see that many more snaps than Oliver, he saw a whole lot more carries. I don’t expect 16 carries in the next few games but the volume is comforting. While he did not see a target, he did get 9 third down snaps which led the team and ran some routes out wide. With increased efficiency he could be a RB1, but right now he is a volume driven low-end RB1/high-end RB2.

**Backup: Branden Oliver**
Oliver ran like a man on a mission and he should get more involved as he is acclimated to this offense. He did have a drop on 3 targets but he managed to haul in a screen for 6 yards. He trailed Bouagnon by three 3rd down snaps but he had 2 more routes ran and his involvement should grow over the coming weeks. He is a fast-rising RB2 to monitor.

**Goalline back: Matt Asiata**

It feels like we were just doing this with Asiata on the Vikings but here he is again vulturing TDs. He is a pretty clear goalline back as he had 2 snaps inside the 5 and 2 in 2pt conversion situations. They even tried to get him involved as a passer in one of those 2pt situations, but Asiata was not able to make the catch. He also dropped his other lone scrimmage target. Expect Asiata to be a TD-dependent RB3/4 and a thorn in the side of Bouagnon/Oliver owners.

# San Diego Fleet

**Leadback: Ja’Quan Gardner**

Gardner had some great efficiency in the run game and caught 2 of his 3 targets for 17 yards. The target he did not haul in was uncatchable. An almost 70% touch percentage is very attractive but the 3rd down usage was a little alarming. Gardner will need to continue to garner all the carries and catch a few passes to maintain RB1 status.

**3rd Down Back: Paul James**

I think Paul James is flying under the radar for even the most hardcore of AAF fantasy fans. While he got very limited opportunities and had a whopping 0 yards, he played 8 third downs and ran routes on 71% of snaps (15 out of 21). Watching the film, some of these routes were from the slot and some were deeper routes. While he’s a very low end RB2/high-end RB3 for now, if he keeps running routes and getting on the field, the production will come.

**Deep Backup: Terrell Watson.**

There is not much to say about Watson other then the fact that he was listed as the starter and that was certainly not the case. Who knows if they flip everything around but it’s hard to play a guy that only had 3 touches especially when he was only on the field for 9 snaps and ran 3 routes. RB4

## Memphis Express

**Lead back “ish”: Zac Stacy**

Aghhhh. Stacy looked and played really well but the fact that he was only on the field for one snap more than the next highest RB is frightening but the 41% touch share percentage is just good enough to grant lead back “ish” status. The Express look like they want to take the air out of the ball, which is evident by the fact that their FB played 23 snaps, and Stacy was their most effective runner. Stacy should be a volume (on the ground) driven, low-end RB1 but the other backs and general incompetency of this offense caps his weekly upside.

**Grinder: Terrence Magee**

While he is not as Stacy they seemed to like using him a decent amount in short yardage situation. Magee also saw some snaps as the QB in the wildcat formation. Like Stacy, Magee was not very involved in the passing game as he was blocking a lot in passing downs. The combination of this offense, Magee’s efficiency, volume, and lack of usage in the passing game make him an uninspiring RB3

**3rd Down back: Raijon Neal**

Neal struggles this game as he averaged 1.3 ypc, had a drop and fumbled. While he only played 2 3rd down snaps they showed a willingness to use him in the passing game. Whether they keep that up is another story, his 8 routes run did lead the team, but one of his targets was a drop and he did fumble to end the game. Another interesting note is that a lot of his targets came when Silvers entered the game and Singletary has already said Hackenberg is starting this week. While that hurts his ranking he still has a similar- slightly better outlook than Magee due to his passing game usage.

**Fullback: Anthony Manzo-Lewis**

This one is pretty literal as he is literally their FB. While he did see the most snaps he did just get 4 carries and only ran 3 routes. While he could fall backwards into some TDs and 2pt conversions, he is basically unplayable as you are hoping from a score from a FB on a terrible offense.

## Atlanta Legends

**Bellcow: Tarean Folston**

Folston is the weakest of the 3 “bellcows” and some wouldn’t consider him one but he logged some serious usage. 20 routes run is very impressive as is the 64% touch percentage. He had 1 drop but he hauled in his other three targets for 13 yards. His efficiency was down and he needs to up that if he wants to maintain RB1 status. However, being one the field this much and running this many routes will translate to fantasy points. Folston is one of the more underrated RBs and is my overall RB4 on the week.

**Part time 3rd down back: Denard Robinson**

While he gets some credit for playing 6 3rd downs and subbing in for Folston on third downs at time he doesn’t quite get the designation of 3rd down back. In order to get that he needs to run a few more routes and get some more targets. You can work with a 30% snap count and he should see more targets as the legends are likely to be down in games like they were last week a lot. While lots of you drafted Robinson high it’s not going to be thrilling to get RB2 production out of him but it could be worse.

**Deep backup: Lawrence Pittman**

Pittman saw a grand total of 1 snap before the final drive. His 8.0 ypc was accumulated on draw plays while the Apollos had won the game. While true Legends could be down big again, you don’t want to rely on this production to continue.
