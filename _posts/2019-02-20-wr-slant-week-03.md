The **_Wide Receiver Slant_** series that focuses on identifying offense specific roles and high volume fantasy options at the WR position.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Alpha Status</h3>

**Charles Johnson – Orlando (\$7,400)**

Last week’s top wide receiver with 192 receiving yards and a score, Charles Johnson deserves his status as [Fanball’s highest priced wide receiver](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF). Johnson not only led his team in wide receiver snaps in Week 2, but received a league-leading 10 targets. On the season, Johnson has seen an incredible 3 red zone and 7 deep targets, creating multiple chances for big plays. With Garrett Gilbert slinging the rock all over the field and Johnson ranking second in the AAF in targets, he should remain the [AAF’s top overall receiver](/leaderboards/receiving).

**Mekale McKay – San Antonio (\$6,200)**

After leading Week 1 with 12 targets, #AlphaMcKay reasserted his dominance with an additional 9 targets in Week 2. While he turned these targets into a mere 2 catches for 36 yards, McKay’s day could have been enormous. McKay saw a league-leading 6 red zone targets in Week 2 and added an additional 2 targets past 15 yards. On the season McKay [leads the league](/leaderboards/receiving) with 21 overall targets, including 8 in the red zone and 6 deep looks. With volume on his side, expect a bounce-back week for McKay against the Fleet.

**Quinton Patton – Birmingham (\$6,300)**

While the Iron remain a tier below the high-octane offense of the Apollos or Commanders, they remain one of the pass-heaviest offense in the AAF. So far this season, Luis Perez has attempted the second-most passes (71), targeting Quinton Patton on 16 of these throws. Patton’s 10 deep targets also lead the entire AAF, allowing him to rack up the third-most receiving yards so far this season (151). Tied for the [second-most targets in the league](/leaderboards/receiving), Patton’s voluminous, field-stretching role should lead to blow up weeks in the future.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">On the Come Up</h3>

**Richard Mullaney – Arizona (\$4,400)**

After reeling in 5 catches for 57 yards in Week 1, Richard Mullaney disappointed in Week 2 with only 11 yards on 2 catches. However, Mullaney’s snap share crested 90%, playing only behind Rashad Ross in the Arizona offense. Also noteworthy, Mullaney appears to have carved out a role as the Hotshot’s primary red zone receiver. Standing 6-3, Mullaney’s 3 red zone targets currently lead the team. With a Week 1 rematch on deck against the Stallions, who the Hotshots flamed for 275 passing yards, Mullaney looks like a solid bounce-back candidate in Week 3.

**De’Markus Ayers – San Antonio (\$6,000)**

After missing Week 1 with an injury, De’Marcus Ayers immediately played the third-most wide receiver snaps on the Commanders in Week 2. More importantly, Ayers notched 5 catches for 80 yards on 8 targets, with 5 of those targets traveling more than 15 yards. Ayers also received a pair of red zone targets, but failed to record a touchdown. While Ayers remains a complimentary receiver for the moment, hanging just below a 50% snap share, his usage remains promising in the league’s second-highest scoring offense.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Dart Throws</h3>

**Ervin Philips – Atlanta (\$3,000)**

A complete leap of faith at the min-price on Fanball, Ervin Philips failed to record a catch in Week 2 as the Atlanta Legends fell to the San Diego Fleet. However, Philips played the second-most receiver snaps on the Legends. While Atlanta’s offense has struggled to start the year, Philips has received both a red zone and deep target this season, showing some involvement in the Atlanta offense. With Atlanta likely to play from behind again this week against the 2-0 Birmingham Iron, Philips could see additional work in the passing game and pay off his min-price on Fanball.

**Adonis Jennings – Salt Late (\$3,900)**

This play remains highly dependent on the injury situation surrounding Salt Lake’s receiving corps. Last week, Kenny Bell, Dres Anderson, and Kaelin Clay failed to suit up for game action, allowing Adonis Jennings to lead the Stallions in snaps. Notably, Jennings also led the team with 7 targets in Week 2, including a red zone look. Listed atop the depth chart and with [Josh Woodrum practicing again](https://twitter.com/chantelbuchi/status/1097941985879646209), Jennings should pay off his near-min price on volume alone.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Tread Carefully</h3>

**Chris Thompson – Orlando (\$4,700)**

With Orlando’s offense absolutely sizzling, Chris Thompson has contributed with a strong 6 catches for 100 receiving yards, currently ranking 7th overall in the AAF. However, despite the strong start, Thompson looks primed for regression after failing to reach a 20% snap share in Week 2. Orlando seems to prefer Rannell Hall as their third receiver, with Thompson playing as a situational deep threat (2 deep targets). In such a niche role, Thompson remains unlikely to contribute on a week-to-week basis.

**Francis Owusu – San Diego (\$4,300)**

Formerly pegged as the San Diego Fleets’ number one receiver, Francis Owusu has disappointed through two weeks of game action with only 2 catches for 12 yards. More disappointing yet, Owusu has yet to crest 50% of the Fleets’ snaps, playing behind Brian Brown and Kameron Kelly. Also troubling for Owusu, neither Philip Nelson nor Mike Bercovici has been able to complete even 50% of their passes. Without competent quarterback play or a full-time role in the San Diego offense, Owusu looks like a mere dart throw for fantasy purposes.
