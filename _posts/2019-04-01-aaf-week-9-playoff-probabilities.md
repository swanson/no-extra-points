Using 538's Elo ratings methodology (found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/)), I've put together the current Elo ratings for the AAF. The only change I've made to 538's formula is that currently I do not include a home-field advantage modifier since I don't feel like there is enough data to calculate one yet.

I simulated the season 10,000 times to predict each teams' estimated wins, losses, and postseason results. Regarding postseason probabilities, I'm using the following tie-breakers: overall winning percentage, then division winning percentage, then head-to-head, then strength of victory, then a coin flip.

Ratings and percentages are rounded.

{% assign week_key = "week-09" %}
{% assign elo_key = week_key | append: "-elo" %}
{% assign odds_key = week_key | append: "-odds" %}

<div>
  <h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Elo Ratings</h3>
  <table class="elo-table nowrap stripe">
    <thead>
      <tr class="text-xs bg-blue-lightest">
        <th>Elo Rating</th>
        <th>Change</th>
        <th>Team</th>
        <th>Record</th>
        <th>eWin</th>
        <th>eLoss</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% for rating in site.data.playoff_odds[elo_key] %}
        <tr class="text-xs text-center">
          <td>{{ rating.elo_rating }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.change }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.team }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.record }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.ewin }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.eloss }}</td>
        </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
  </table>

Orlando survived a close -- and sloppy -- game against Memphis, but even in defeat the Express still maintained a slim possibility for the postseason. However, those dreams were dashed for both Memphis and Atlanta as Birmingham locked up their playoff ticket after beating the Legends.

Arizona won another huge game this week, this time defeating San Antonio. The win puts them in the driverâ€™s seat of the West. Even with the loss, San Antonio is still in good shape to advance and it looks like these two teams will play the rubber match of their series in three weeks.
