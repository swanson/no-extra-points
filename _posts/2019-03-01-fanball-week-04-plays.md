<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## Garrett Gilbert – Orlando (\$7,100)

Looking largely unfadeable, Garrett Gilbert racked up his third straight 20+ point performance last week. To start the season, Gilbert’s 827 passing yards come in almost 200 yards higher than Logan Woodside (629) at number two. Gilbert and the Apollos also find themselves in a plus matchup against a Salt Lake team allowing the second-most passing yards per game (227). Favored by 6.5-points in the slates highest Vegas total game, Gilbert should put up points again in this contest.

## Trent Richardson – Birmingham (\$7,600)

Also impossible to fade, Trent Richardson continues to work as the AAF’s lone bell-cow. Richardson’s 59 carries and 23 red zone touches easily lead the AAF. While Richardson has shown mediocre efficiency, recording only 145 yards on his immense volume, he remains the only running back in the league to record at least a 69% snap share in each game played. Richardson remains an elite play across formats this week.

## Nelson Spruce – San Diego (\$6,000)

Listed as the backup to start last week, Nelson Spruce emerged in a big way, leading San Diego in all major receiving categories in Week 3. Seeing 7 targets and 120 air yards in that contest, Spruce appears to have emerged as the team’s top wide receiver option. Spruce and the Fleet remain the AAF’s second pass-heaviest team and draw a matchup against an Express defense that has allowed the third-most passing yards per game this season. Priced at only \$6000, Spruce fits easily into most lineup builds.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## Zach Mettenberger – Memphis (\$5,500)

With Christian Hackenberg finally moving to the bench, Zach Metterberger stepped in to complete 75% of passes, while throwing for 120 yards and a pair of scores in only a half of football. Breathing life into this dormant offense, Mettenberger comes in incredibly cheap, priced as the seventh-most expensive quarterback on the slate. San Diego has held opponents below 175 passing yards each of the past two weeks, but at \$5500 Mettenberger looks like a strong salary saving option.

## Terrell Watson – San Diego (\$4,900)

Terrell Watson has flown under the radar with backfield partner Ja’Quan Gardner leading the league in rushing yards (281). However, Watson actually out-snapped (60%-40%) and out-carried Gardner (13-12) altogether. This trend continued into the red zone, where Watson recorded 3 carries to Gardner’s 1 in Week 3. Watson also recorded the team’s only goal line snaps (5) as well. Priced \$2,100 cheaper than Gardner, Watson looks like a supreme value on this slate.

## Devin Lucien – Memphis (\$4,300)

With Memphis’ offense looking primed to see an increase in production, many of their receivers look like attractive options near the minimum price. The cheapest of the starting receivers, Devin Lucien, appears to have carved out a role for himself. Last week, Lucien reeled in 3 of 3 targets for 51 yards and a score. Seeing 45 air yards on the day, Lucien looks like a starting caliber receiver in the AAF. Now officially listed as a starter on the Express depth chart, Lucien’s cheap price allows multiple studs into GPP/cash lineups.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Pairing</h3>

## John Wolford ($5,700) / Mekale McKay ($6,300)

It's not a traditional QB/WR stack from the same team, but building lineups around these two core plays is my favorite way to start GPP lineups this week.

After leaving Week 3 with an injury, John Wolford looks on track to suit up for Week 4. Severely dropping in price, Wolford comes in as the sixth-most expensive quarterback on the slate. Unlike most quarterbacks in the AAF, Wolford brings a decent rushing floor, leading the league with 17 carries. As a passer, Wolford 63% completion percentage comes in near the top of the league, making him a solid value play on the slate.

Mekale McKay stands out from volume perspective. McKay leagues the league in both targets (27) and red zone targets (9). Mckay has also seen the fourth-most air yards (302), showing the ability to make plays on the ball down the field.

Fire these two up with confidence -- together -- in GPPs for Week 4.
