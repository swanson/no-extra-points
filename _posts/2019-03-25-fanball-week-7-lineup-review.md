My favorite fantasy column is [Adam Levitan's Cash Game Review](https://www.draftkings.com/playbook/nfl/fantasy-football-adam-levitans-week-17-cash-game-review). [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamlevitan) is so open about his process, even when he has losing weeks, and I really admire that about him. Learning how he constructs lineups is invaluable.

In that same spirit, I will be reviewing my AAF lineups from the upstart DFS site [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com) -- currently the [only game in town](/ultimate-guide-to-aaf-fantasy) when it comes to DFS for this niche league.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Week 7 - Fanball Lineups</h3>

Ownership converged on a few plays this week, due to injuries and a shrinking field size. Brandon Ross was ruled out, locking in Trent Richardson's already massive usage. Emerging stud WR Dontez Ford was also unable to go, pushing ownership to Charles Johnson and Rashad Ross. And nearly half the field played D'Ernest Johnson -- still unpriced relative to other starting backs -- against the "flow chart" Atlanta defense.

<h3 class="aaf-header-small">My Main Slate Exposure</h3>

I built ten lineups and ended up with these exposures:

### QB Pool

- Wolford - 60%
- Gilbert - 20%
- Woodrum - 10%
- Woodside - 10%

I'm just going to keep plugging in Wolford until he is priced above guys like Bercovici, Murray, Perez, and Woodside. Wolford has shown that he is one of the few that can match Gilbert's upside and he has a stable of weapons. I'll take the savings and roll with the AAF Hall of Famer as this ARI team desperately fights for a playoff birth.

### RB Pool

- Richardson - 80%
- D Johnson - 60%
- Pressley - 40%
- Watson - 10%

Richardson was basically a lock, I only left him out of two of my ten lineups in order to fit in ORL stacks.

D'Ernest is the most talented back for ORL and the only one with a defined pass catching role.

Pressley has put some distance between Cook and Stockton, but was still priced down.

Watson has been operating as a co-starter for the Fleet, outplayed Gardner and getting both short yardage and passing game work.

### WR Pool

- Mullaney - 100%
- C Johnson - 50%
- Ross - 30%
- McKay - 30%
- Ward - 30%
- Jennings - 20%
- Truesdell - 20%
- Patton - 10%
- Washington - 10%
- Etta-Tawo - 10%

There was a bit of uncertainty heading into the week due to injuries. Rashad Ross has been beat up -- struggling after every big tackle and missing snaps as he gets medical attention. Knowing that Ross may be limited and that Mullaney was still not priced correctly, I went all-in on Mullaney.

Mekale McKay was also questionable after missing some practice time. Additionally, DeMarcus Ayers was announced as doubtful -- potentially opening up a few more looks for Greg Ward Jr. 

Ward was priced way down after failing to eclipse 30 yards since week 01, but he was seeing a consistent ~4 targets and had an explosive punt return touchdown last week. Between Mullaney and Ward, you could jam in any of the high priced guys you wanted.

I splashed in some exposure to the Salt Lake and Birmingham passing games -- both of which were coming off big games.

## My Lineups

I wrote in my notes "Game stack ARI-SD" but I ended up playing a bunch of ORL players instead. It's hard to deal with the Apollos -- they are clearly the best team, but the fantasy production is often spread out and they can take their feet of the gas since they rarely are playing from behind.

Being overweight on Wolford (QB1 on the week) was not enough to eek out a small profit. I had no shares of De'Veon Smith or Nelson Spruce so a win was basically out of the question. Reece Horn coming up with a huge TD late bumped me off the bubble in the $20 tournament.

Overall, I wish I would have game-stacked a bit more and been more bold on some of my lower-owned calls (Watson, Truesdell).
