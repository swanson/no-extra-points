The weekly **_Fanball DFS Rundown_** series covers the locks, cheap options, and high risk tournament stacks to target in this week's AAF daily fantasy contests on [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF).

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## Garrett Gilbert – Orlando (\$6,800)

Easily the AAF’s most consistent quarterback, Garrett Gilbert’s price actually fell by \$300 heading into Week 5. Coming off a 244-yard performance, Gilbert boasts a clean 62% completion percentage, along with a league leading 1,071 passing yards. Gilbert could have his work cut out for him this week, facing an Iron defense that has allowed the fewest passing yards per game (164.3). However, with the league’s top receiver at his disposal (Charles Johnson), Gilbert must remain in consideration across formats despite the perceived tough matchup.

## Jhurell Pressley – Arizona (\$6,900)

Usurping Trent Richardson at the top of this list, Jhurell Pressley has worked his way back into bell-cow status for the Arizona Hotshots. Richardson saw his snaps fall for the second-consecutive week and received less than 50% of his team’s backfield touches for the first time all season. Conversely, Pressley earned 72% of the Hotshot’s Week 4 running back opportunities, playing a majority of the snaps. Also important, Pressley recorded the Hotshot’s lone red zone rushing attempt, which occurred on the goal line. Priced as the second-most expensive running back on the slate, Pressley warrants cash consideration.

## Rashad Ross – Arizona (\$7,400)

On the same team as Pressley, Rashad Ross remains one of the top wide receiver plays on the board with a matchup against a San Antonio secondary allowing the most passing yards per game (258). Ross currently ranks fourth in targets (26) and air yards (379), with four total red zone targets. With Josh Huff landing on injured reserve this week, Ross could handle an elevated target share this weekend. Only \$500 cheaper than Charles Johnson, Ross should provide leverage in GPPs.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## Mike Bercovici – San Diego (\$5,000)

With Phillip Nelson breaking his clavicle, the San Diego Fleet named Mike Bercovici their starting quarterback. Priced at the stone minimum, Bercovici faces off against a pass-funnel Salt Lake defense, allowing the second-most passing yards per game (231.3). As a team, San Diego has passed at the second-highest rate in the AAF (62%), providing Bercovici enough volume to succeed at his price. With multiple attractive studs at the top, Bercovici allows enough savings to jam a few stars into lineups.

## Joel Bouagnon – Salt Late (\$5,300)

After Branden Oliver suffered a groin injury mid-way through Week 4, Joel Bouagnon stepped in to handle 8 carries, including the team’s only red zone attempt. Bouagnon has shown a nose for the end zone throughout the season, notching 11 red zone carries to date. Oliver missed practice to start the week and looks questionable at best for this weekend’s action. If Oliver misses the game altogether, Bouagnon would become a must play across game formats on Fanball.

## Mekale McKay – San Antonio (\$5,100)

After weather influenced San Antonio’s Week 4 tilt, Mekale McKay finished with 2 catches for 19 yards, frustrating fantasy owners. However, no Commanders receiver bested 24 yards, while the team leaned heavily on Kenneth Farrow. On the season, McKay still ranks second in targets (31), third in air yards (427), and first in red zone targets (9). Simply seeing too much opportunity at his price point, McKay looks like a cash lock heading into the weekend.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Pairing</h3>

## Aaron Murray ($5,900) / Seantavius Jones ($4,400)

Stepping in for the incompetent Matt Simms, Aaron Murray provided a much-needed spark to the Atlanta offense. Passing for 254 yards and rushing for another 54, Murray led the Legends to their first win in AAF history. With a 60% completion percentage, Murray looks more than capable of leading this Atlanta offense going forward.

As a stacking partner, Seantavius Jones comes in particularly cheap this week. While Jones failed to corral either of his 2 targets in Week 4, he continued to work as a starting receiver for the Legends. On the season, Jones ranks fifth in targets (25) and air yards (329), with 5 red zone targets. Providing salary relief, this stack should go low-owned in GPPs this weekend.
