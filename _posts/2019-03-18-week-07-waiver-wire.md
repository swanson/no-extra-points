For AAF fantasy gamers, Johnny Manziel’s arrival couldn’t come soon enough. That much was clear from social media buzz when the polarizing quarterback signed with Memphis on Saturday after the team claimed him off waivers. It’s impeccable timing for the former first-round pick of the Cleveland Browns, as starter Zach Mettenberger suffered an ankle injury on Memphis’ first drive and did not return. He watched on crutches as backup Brandon Silvers finished the game.

Manziel is an automatic add with the caveat being he probably won’t play in Week 7. Past the midway point in the AAF season, Memphis (1-5) sits last in the East Division with the worst record in the league. The Express will miss the playoffs barring some sort of miracle. Silvers looked competent in relief, and with precious little time to learn the offense Manziel is a long shot to play.

When Manziel does take the field, what should we expect?

His documented struggles in the NFL include a career 74.4 passer rating and 57-percent completion percentage – not to mention his off-the-field antics. In two seasons with the Brows he completed 147 of 258 passes for 1,675 yards (6.5 YPA), seven TDs and seven interceptions. He’s three seasons removed from his last NFL game, a Week 16 loss to Kansas City in 2015.

Johnny Football tried to resurrect his career in the CFL in 2018, but didn’t fare much better in limited action. He was traded to Montreal after starting the season with Hamilton, and completed 106 of 165 total passes (64%) for 1,290 yards, five TDs and seven INTs. He added 215 yards on 29 carries (7.1 YPC).

Manziel’s rushing prowess sets him apart, and his dual-threat athleticism offers massive upside in the AAF. In his aforementioned NFL finale, he set a career high with 108 rushing yards on 11 attempts (9.8 YPC).

Gamers at or near the top of their respective league standings have the luxury of taking a wait-and-see approach with Manziel, but those in "win now" mode should look to the next two candidates instead.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Quarterbacks</h3>

## Luis Perez, Birmingham

Perez flashed his beast mode in a surprise performance one week after he was benched for Keith Price. But Price took a huge hit from Damontre Moore that knocked him out of the game in the first quarter. Enter Perez, who had his best game of the season and threw his first TD pass. He finished 27 of 49 for 359 yards, three TDs, two INTs and a 2-point conversion. It was a huge 360 for Perez, who played the first 17 quarters of the season without throwing a TD before he was benched. He looks to have taken a step forward and may have done enough to reclaim the starting job. It’s a volatile situation, but prioritize Perez if you need to win now.

## Brandon Silvers, Memphis

If you need a spot start QB for Week 7 then Silvers is your second-best option. However, his time may be short-lived with Johnny Manziel waiting in the wings. Silvers completed 23 of 37 passes for 242 yards and a TD with no picks in relief of Zach Mettenberger. He showed a great connection with Reece Horn and Daniel Williams, who combined to catch 15 of 21 targets for 199 yards. No other Memphis wide receiver saw more than five targets or caught more than two passes.

## Situations to Monitor

Logan Woodside appeared to hurt his hand in San Antonio’s rout of Atlanta and his situation should be monitored. He was fantastic though, tossing a pair of TD passes for the second straight week. Dustin Vaughn came on with 6:15 remaining and the game in hand. He threw two passes, both of which were incomplete.

Aaron Murray was picked three times – including an ugly pick-6 – and was replaced by Peter Pujals with 8:40 remaining and the Legends trailing 19-6. Pujals completed 4 of 6 passes for 17 yards. Matt Simms appears to be relegated to third string. Pujals is a speculative add.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Running Backs</h3>

**Prioritize if still available:** Terrence Magee

## Marshaun Coprich, Birmingham

Trent Richardson doesn’t look to be slowing down any time soon. He resumed his massive workload in Week 6, garnering 23 touches. But with normal backup Brandon Ross out with injury, Coprich saw his first game action of the regular season. He finished with 5.5 fantasy points, rushing twice for seven yards and catching all three of his targets for 18 yards. The passing game usage is encouraging, but it will take an injury to Ross or Richardson for Coprich to get more usage and ascend to fantasy relevance. He’s strictly a deep league sleeper add and a handcuff to Richardson.

## Situations to Monitor

The waiver wire didn’t produce any priority adds at running back this week, so options are limited. However, check on the availability of Tim Cook, Terrell Newby, Akeem Hunt and Brandon Radcliff (monitor his injury). They are upside adds and have flown a bit under the radar.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Wide Receivers</h3>

## Richard Mullaney, Arizona

Mullaney returned from injury to lead the Hotshots in receiving, catching 6 of 7 targets (a season-high) for 73 yards. He’s a player to watch down the stretch, especially with Rashad Ross banged up. One of the AAF’s best receivers, Ross was visibly hobbled Saturday and has been dealing with a shoulder injury. If he misses time Mullaney could get elevated to Alpha status. Due to Mullaney’s previous injury, which caused him to miss Weeks 3-5, he’s still widely available with plenty of upside.

## Daniel Williams, Memphis

Williams is a sneaky-good add this week, a talented player who will get glossed over in the Manziel madness. The 23-year-old undrafted free agent from Jackson State made his AAF debut one to remember. He was targeted 11 times – twice in the red zone - and caught seven passes for 70 yards. Williams had an eye-popping 139 air yards and is a playmaker to watch. He’s 6-4, 234 pounds and runs a 4.56 40-yard dash. Those are some wheels for guy of his stature. Williams was waived by the Browns this past offseason after being signed to their practice squad for the last four weeks of the season.

## Situations to Monitor

In the middle of an amazing performance Dontez Ford was injured on a 72-yard catch and run in the third quarter and did not return. He still finished with 182 yards on three catches with an incredible 122 YAC. Losing Ford would be a huge blow to the Fleet and leave them without a true No. 1 option.

After seeing a combined two targets in his first two games, the Iron’s Jamal Robinson caught 2 of 3 targets for 78 yards. His biggest catch went for 40 yards.

Adonis Jennings led the Stallions with eight targets, catching four of them for 51 yards. It was the first time he scored more than six fantasy points this season (9.1). He has yet to score a TD.

Jordan Leslie returned from injury and caught all three of his targets for 21 yards and a 2-point conversion. The targets tied a season high.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Tight Ends</h3>

**Prioritize if still available:** Nick Truesdell, Scott Orndorff

## Cam Clear, San Antonio

The tight end carousel keeps spinning for San Antonio. Cole Hunt, Evan Rodriguez, Stehly Reden and Clear have all flashed at times this season. But the injured Hunt hasn’t played since Week 3, Reden wasn’t targeted in Week 6 and Rodriguez has laid two fantasy eggs to date. Clear and Rodriguez both showed up in Week 6, though. Clear caught all five of his targets – a la Nick Truesdell – for 45 yards. Rodriguez added a 33-yard TD catch, his second of the season. The Commanders have won three straight and are the hottest offensive team in the AAF, scoring 37 points in Week 6 and 29 in Week 5.

## Ben Johnson, San Diego

Johnson looks to be taking over as the Fleet’s red zone monster. He caught a TD for the second straight game, and has seen three red zone targets and scored 20.1 fantasy points during that span. Johnson caught all three of his targets in Week 6 for nine yards.

## Situations to Monitor

Truesdell has caught all 18 of his targets for 181 yards and three TDs. He is the definition of efficient. His 17.7 Week 6 fantasy points led the position. Dude is a league-winner.

After a breakout Week 5, Scott Orndorff failed to record a catch as the Apollos lost their first game of the season.
