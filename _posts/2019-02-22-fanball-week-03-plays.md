The weekly **_Fanball DFS Rundown_** series covers the locks, cheap options, and high risk tournament stacks to target in this week's AAF daily fantasy contests on [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF).

Fanball is hosting a special free contest for NoExtraPoints readers: [\$25 NoExtraPoints Free Roll](https://www.fanball.com/contests/EdH8GG) -- see if you can beat our scores this week!

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## John Wolford – Arizona (\$6,800)

While Garrett Gilbert remains the most expensive quarterback on the slate (for good reason), John Wolford should bring similar upside at significantly less ownership. Wolford boasts the league’s second-highest completion percentage (62.75%) and a league-high six passing touchdowns through two games.

Unlike most other AAF quarterbacks, Wolford also provides a solid rushing floor, leading the league with 15 rushing attempts this season. For those looking to pivot from Gilbert, Wolford offers contrarian upside in GPPs this weekend.

## Trent Richardson – Arizona (\$7,200)

Eating the Trent Richardson chalk at running back looks inevitable this week. Richardson leads the AAF with a massive 51 touches. While inefficient, Richardson’s role as the league’s lone bell-cow remains impossible to fade.

The former Alabama star also leads all running backs with 42 carries and 11 targets, with an additional 12 carries in the red zone. While he has yet to reach 100 cumulative rushing yards, strong volume and a match up against an Atlanta run defense that has allowed the most rushing yards per game (161) AAF make Richardson impossible to fade.

## Mekale McKay – San Antonio (\$6,200)

After leading the AAF with 12 targets in Week 1, Mekale “Big Play” McKay doubled down with another 9 looks in Week 2. While he managed only 2 catches for 36 yards, McKay saw 6 red zone and 2 deep targets.

Through two weeks, McKay continues to lead the league with 21 overall targets, but comes in as Fanball’s fifth-most expensive receiver. He currently leads the AAF with 8 red zone targets overall and should see positive regression in the coming weeks.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## Josh Woodrum – Salt Lake (\$5,200)

After missing Week 2 with a hamstring injury, Josh Woodrum practiced to begin Week 3. Still largely an unknown, Woodrum passed for 103 yards in limited action in Week 1. The former Liberty quarterback possesses decent athleticism, running a 4.80-40-yard dash coming out of college and rushing for 2 scores in the 2017 preseason.

Absurdly priced below Christian Hackenberg, Woodrum warrants consideration as such a cheap price.

## Branden Oliver – Salt Lake – (\$4,500)

On the same team, Branden Oliver emerged as Salt Lake’s lead back in Week 2, recording the most backfield snaps and touches (16) in Week 2. More importantly, Oliver saw 4 red zone carries, which finished above teammate Joel Bouagnon (2).

Priced at \$1,000 less than Bouagnon, Oliver remains the preferred option among Salt Lake running backs and deserves cash consideration, given price. Arizona showed major leaks on the ground last week, allowing 175 rushing yards Zac Stacy and company with the Memphis Express.

## Rannell Hall – (\$4,300) – Orlando

While many will gravitate towards Chris Thompson and Ishmael Hyman in the same offense, Rannell Hall actually worked as Orlando’s third wide receiver. While he only has 2 receptions for 19 yards on the year, Hall has seen adequate usage in the Orlando receiving game. On the year he has 2 red zone targets, 1 red zone carry, and two deep targets.

While he doesn’t bring a solid floor like some cheaper receivers, Hall’s role in Orlando’s high-octane offense brings enough upside to warrant GPP consideration.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Stack</h3>

## QB Luis Perez ($5,700) / WR Quinton Patton ($6,300)

Coming off a down week, Luis Perez’s price fell in the Fanball pricing. However, Perez has shown promise as a passer, completing just over 60% of his passes on the second most attempts in the AAF (71). He has also shown a willingness to air the ball out, throwing 15 down-field passes.

Perez’s premier stacking partner, Quinton Patton, has received a league-high 10 looks down the field. Through two games, Patton remains tied for the second-most targets (16) and ranks third in receiving yards (151). Patton presents slate breaking ability.

Together, Perez and Patton figure to come in under-owned as Garrett Gilbert / Charles Johnson stacks populate DFS lineups.
