My favorite fantasy column is [Adam Levitan's Cash Game Review](https://www.draftkings.com/playbook/nfl/fantasy-football-adam-levitans-week-17-cash-game-review). [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamlevitan) is so open about his process, even when he has losing weeks, and I really admire that about him. Learning how he constructs lineups is invaluable.

In that same spirit, I will be reviewing my AAF lineups from the upstart DFS site [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com) -- currently the [only game in town](/ultimate-guide-to-aaf-fantasy) when it comes to DFS for this niche league.

## Week 2 - Fanball Lineup

Like last week, I tried to max enter every guaranteed contest. This week there was more interest in the league and sites like ActionNetwork, FantasyPros, and Rotogrinders were putting out content. The OG Evan Silva even did a Matchups column and was in nearly all of the contest lobbies. Exciting!

My experience with leagues like the CFL and AAF tells me that you need to quickly figure out which players are actually good and which players just had good first week performances. Everyone playing in week two is going to be using boxscores to drive their lineups. The edge comes from being able to pick the players that will continue to produce week after week.

For example, I think the big questions for this week were: who are the top offenses among Arizona, Orlando, Birmingham, and San Antonio?

Which of the three top performing WRs in week one would repeat? Quinton Patton, Rashard Ross, Jalin Marshall?

Would either Charles Johnson or Mekale McKay bounce back after huge ownership in week one?

After answering those questions, roster construction became pretty clear as pricing on Fanball was a little soft as we still adjust to these players.

### My Must Plays

San Antonio WR [Mekale McKay](/players/mekale-mckay/)

McKay lead the league in targets in week one (12) and caught 5/80yds. He also had a long 40yd pass overturned by review and was targeted twice in the endzone. McKay was solid but could have had a monster week. I wanted to go back to the well for McKay -- who I thought was the top overall WR and might be slightly underowned after the week one boxscores from Marshall, Ross, and Patton.

Arizona QB [John Wolford](/players/john-wolford)

I was mostly off of Arizona last week. While they were projected to the top team in the league, there was a lot of confusion over who would be the starting QB and what the WR usage would look like. After one game, it was clear that Wolford is the guy in the Arizona and looks like a bonafide MVP candidate. Wolford exploded for 4 TDs and had 8 carries -- cementing him as the elite floor and ceiling play.

Quarterback is very thin in the AAF at the moment. Garret Gilbert and John Wolford are really the only options. So I was locking in Wolford, who was not much more expensive than the field at \$6600.

Arizona RB [Jhurell Pressley](/players/jhurell-pressley)

Based on the [week one RB platoon report](https://noextrapoints.com/rb-platoon-report-week-01), we knew there were only a couple of likely bellcow options. Trent Richardson was one, but was listed as Questionable all week and backup running back LaDarius Perkins had 6 targets last week. I thought Pressley would see the bulk of the workload for the best offense in the league, playing against bottom-feeder Memphis. Game script was set up for an Arizona blowout, as Vegas had the Hotshots as a massive 16-pts road favorite.

Pairing Pressley and Wolford meant I should have lots of TD equity for Arizona.

### My Want Plays

Birmingham WR [Quinton Patton](/players/quinton-patton)

Patton and QB Luis Perez had an obvious connection in week one. Patton led the league in receiving with 107 yds and a sturdy 7 targets. With other starting WR Amba Etta-Tawo ruled out for the Iron, Patton figured to be the target hog. I was concerned about his drops -- he only made 3 catches on his 7 targets -- but felt like I need to get him into my lineup based on his projected huge ownership. Many of the others folks in the AAF fantasty community were high on Birmingham's offense this week and this was where I chose to get my piece.

Orlando WR [Jalin Marshall](/players/jalin-marshall)

I needed to get a piece of the Orlando offense and Marshall's price ($5300) fit my construction. He scored 2 touchdowns (one receiving, one passing) in week one and his piece had not been bumped up high enough. I liked Charles Johnson but I couldn't hit his $6000 tag and I wasn't sure about his usage after leaving week one with an injury. This play was a bit of a block as well, since Marshall figured to be Chalky after scoring 18 fpts in week one.

### The rest of the roster

I was left with one spot for SD WR [Brian Brown](/players/brian-brown) a consensus min-priced lock. He is starting for the Fleet, had 5 catches for 66 yards last week, and was going against a dreadful Atlanta team. He was the free square.

### Week 2 Results

It was a bad week for my squad. I even late-swapped from Brown to RB Paul James -- a super thin play -- to avoid drawing dead during the last game. I went heavy on Arizona and bounce-back candidate Mekale McKay. I correctly identified that Birmingham was not an offense to target and Orlando was, but had the wrong pieces.

I went Patton over Ross (9 pt swing).
I went Pressley over Richardson (15 pt swing).
I prioritize McKay, which pushed me off Johnson and onto Marshall (17 pt swing).

I'm happy that I was able to narrow down to a really good player pool, but I made the wrong calls and locked in on McKay. His high salary shaped my process, taking me toward the $5k receiver range (Patton, Marshall) instead of the $6k range (Johnson, Ross).

My stubbornness to not play Trent Richardson did not help. I was playing one of Pressley or Richardson. When I went Pressley and Wolford, I did not want to also play Ross -- which helped me rationalize Patton.
