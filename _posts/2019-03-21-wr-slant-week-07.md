The **_Wide Receiver Slant_** is a weekly series that focuses on identifying offense specific roles and high volume fantasy options at the WR position.

After another high scoring Week 6, wide receivers stole in the show in fantasy. However, L’Damian Washington and Dontez Ford actually led the week in scoring at the position, with Charles Johnson and Rashad Ross taking a backseat. With Week 7 looming, here are a few trends to monitor at the wide receiver position.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Alpha Status</h3>

## Rashad Ross – Arizona (\$7,100)

Competing with only Charles Johnson for the AAF’s top receiver, Rashad Ross saw immense volume again in Week 6. With 10 targets at 161 air yards, Ross’ 0.91 WOPR led the league altogether. On the year, Ross leads the AAF in receiving touchdowns, seeing 27% of his team’s red zone targets. Ross also currently ranks tied for third in targets (42) and third in air yards (647). The former Washington Redskin now faces a San Diego defense that has allowed the most passing yards per game over the last three weeks (312.3). Priced behind only Johnson, Ross remains worth the high cost on Fanball.

## Quinton Patton – Birmingham (\$5,600)

Still priced among the mid-tier receivers, Quinton Patton leads the AAF in both targets (53) and air yards (692). However, Patton miraculously ranks seventh in receiving yards (305) and has yet to score a touchdown. Importantly, Patton’s 9 red zone targets lead his team and rank fourth overall in the AAF. With Birmingham leading the league in pass attempts (289) and passing at the highest rate in the AAF (68%), Patton should see big weeks in the near future.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">On the Come Up</h3>

## Richard Mullaney – Arizona (\$4,400)

Returning from injury, Richard Mullaney played an every-down role for the Arizona Hotshots, finishing with a solid 6 catches for 73 yards in Week 6. On the day, Mullaney’s 7 targets and 75 air yards both ranked second on the team. Prior to his injury, Mullaney also played a curial role in the red zone, leading the team in red zone targets (3) through the first two weeks. Just like Ross above, Mullaney should benefit from a match against the porous San Diego pass defense in Week 7, yet comes in at a fraction of the price.

## Daniel Williams – Memphis (\$4,900)

Seemingly appearing out of thin air, Daniel Williams burst onto the scene in Week 6, posting 70 receiving yards on 7 catches. More importantly, Williams ran as a starter and led the Express in targets (11), while seeing a healthy 139 air yards. Williams could have volatile weeks in the near future, with uncertainty at the quarterback position, but volume trumps all else in fantasy football. For the time being, he looks like a starter in seasonal leagues and a contrarian option in DFS.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Dart Throws</h3>

## Adonis Jennings – Salt Late (\$4,200)

Previously one of the run-heaviest teams in the AAF, Josh Woodrum’s 85 pass attempts rank number one in the AAF in the past two weeks. In that time, Adonis Jennings has worked as a starting receiver and the team’s primary deep threat. In Week 6, Jennings led the team in both targets (8) and air yards (170). In what projects as a high-scoring affair against the San Antonio Commanders, Jennings and his deep threat ability warrant consideration as a cheap dart throw.

## Greg Ward Jr. – San Antonio (\$3,800)

Every week Greg Ward’s price drops and every week I continue to write him up. Last week, Ward displayed his play making ability with a first half punt return touchdown that unfortunately did not count for fantasy. However, Ward continued to act as the Commanders’ second receiver and recorded another 3 red zone targets. Up to 13 red zone targets this season, Ward has yet to score a receiving touchdown. With Salt Lake and league’s premier pass-funnel defense on deck, Ward offers too much savings to pass up.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Tread Carefully</h3>

## L’Damian Washington – Birmingham (\$5,700)

In a breakout Week 6 performance, L’Damian Washington erupted for 128 receiving yards and 2 scores on 4 catches. Washington also saw good volume, recording 10 targets and 191 air yards, but a few concerns remain for the promising receiver. For the time being, remains behind Quinton Patton on the depth chart and more importantly, Amba Etta-Tawo projects to make his return in Week 7. While Etta-Tawo hasn’t played in weeks, he started over Washington to start the season. With uncertainty looming, this situation remains a stay away for me.

## De’Mornay Pierson-El – Salt Lake (\$5,800)

After breaking out in Week 5, De’Mornay Pierson-El returned to his floor in Week 6, posting a mere 37 scoreless yards on 5 catches. Seeing only 6 targets and 33 air yards, Pierson-El simply does not possess enough upside to warrant consideration in fantasy. Often likened to the Jarvis Landry of the AAF, Pierson-El’s low ADOT role requires more targets for fantasy relevance. With cheaper options available, Pierson-El can confidently be avoided.
