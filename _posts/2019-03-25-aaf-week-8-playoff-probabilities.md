Using 538's Elo ratings methodology (found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/introducing-nfl-elo-ratings/)), I've put together the current Elo ratings for the AAF. The only change I've made to 538's formula is that currently I do not include a home-field advantage modifier since I don't feel like there is enough data to calculate one yet.

I simulated the season 10,000 times to predict each teams' estimated wins, losses, and postseason results. Regarding postseason probabilities, I'm using the following tie-breakers: overall winning percentage, then division winning percentage, then head-to-head, then strength of victory, then a coin flip.

Ratings and percentages are rounded.

{% assign week_key = "week-08" %}
{% assign elo_key = week_key | append: "-elo" %}
{% assign odds_key = week_key | append: "-odds" %}

<div>
  <h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Elo Ratings</h3>
  <table class="elo-table nowrap stripe">
    <thead>
      <tr class="text-xs bg-blue-lightest">
        <th>Elo Rating</th>
        <th>Change</th>
        <th>Team</th>
        <th>Record</th>
        <th>eWin</th>
        <th>eLoss</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% for rating in site.data.playoff_odds[elo_key] %}
        <tr class="text-xs text-center">
          <td>{{ rating.elo_rating }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.change }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.team }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.record }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.ewin }}</td>
          <td>{{ rating.eloss }}</td>
        </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
  </table>

With a win this week, Orlando became the first team to clinch a playoff berth. Memphis looked to be headed for elimination from playoff contention, but they rallied from an 11-point deficit to tie the game late and then went on to defeat Birmingham in the first overtime game in the Allianceâ€™s short history.

Arizona came away with huge victory over San Diego. The win, which sets up a potential battle for first place in the West next week when they travel to San Antonio, bumped their playoff chances from 41% to 74%.
