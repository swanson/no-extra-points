The weekly **_Fanball DFS Rundown_** series covers the locks, cheap options, and high risk tournament stacks to target in this week's AAF daily fantasy contests on [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF).

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## Garrett Gilbert – Orlando ($6,700) 

Easily the AAF’s top quarterback option, Garrett Gilbert stands in a tier of his own. Gilbert leads the league in passing yards (1,842) and has passed for an absurd 11:1 touchdown to interception ratio. Passing for at least 200 yards in every game this season, Gilbert showed his skill completing an absurd 83% of his passes a week ago. This week, Gilbert faces a Memphis Express team favored by 10-points. The AAF’s model of consistency, Gilbert warrants consideration across formats each and every week. 

## Trent Richardson – Birmingham ($8,000) 

The AAF’s lone true bell-cow running back, Trent Richardson deserves priority in DFS lineups. Richardson not only leads the AAF in carries (107), but he ranks fifth overall in targets (45). He has also seen 31 red zone carries and 11 red zone targets, making him the league’s most valuable runner. Richardson also draws a tantalizing matchup against an Atlanta defense that has allowed the third-most rushing yards per game (118), and 3 touchdowns to Richardson himself in Week 3. Play Richardson comfortably despite the increased price. 

## Rashad Ross – Arizona ($6,900)

Dealing with injury throughout Week 7’s game, Rashad Ross actually saw his price fall ahead of Week 8’s action. Injuries have limited Ross throughout much of the season, but he still ranks fifth in targets (45) and second in air yards (696). Assuming Ross takes the field in Week 8, he draws a solid matchup against a San Antonio secondary that has allowed the most receiving yards per game this season (248). Just three weeks ago, Ross racked up 105 receiving yards and a score against this very San Antonio secondary.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## Josh Woodrum– Salt Lake ($5,700) 

Criminally underpriced, Josh Woodrum finds himself priced below sub-par quarterback options like Mike Bercovici, Luis Perez, and Aaron Murray. So far this season, Woodrum has posted a highly efficient 64% completion percentage along with 1,294 passing yards despite missing a game. In recent weeks, the Stallions have embraced a pass first offense, allowing Woodrum to throw the ball 40 times per game in their last three contests. With job security and a pass first offense on his side, Woodrum should provide salary relief and leverage on the field this week against a league-worst San Diego secondary that has allowed 325 pass yards per game in their last three game. 

## D’Ernest Johnson – Orlando ($4,700) 

On the heels of a De’Veon Smith three touchdown game, D’Ernest Johnson finds himself priced $600 cheaper than the former Michigan Wolverine. Johnson handled a mere 9 touches in Orlando’s blowout win, while Smith and Akeem Hunt handled 14 and 11 respectively. The touch split likely had more to do with Orlando blowing out Atlanta, with Johnson still holding the team lead in snaps. Johnson has shown a high floor throughout the season and Orlando enters this contest with the highest implied point total on the slate (26). Take the savings and jam Johnson into your cash and GPP lineups. 

## Amba Etta-Tawo – Birmingham ($4,100) 

Finally returning from a Week 1 injury, Amba Etta-Tawo stepped into to play a majority of Birmingham’s snaps in Week 7. Luis Perez only targeted Etta-Tawo 4 times, but the receiver reeled in 3 catches for 71 yards. It should be noted that L’Damian Washington sustained a head injury early in this game and did not return. Playing on the pass heaviest team in the AAF, Etta-Tawo could see an increased role with Washington potentially sidelined. With the league-worst Atlanta Legends on deck, Etta-Tawo offers a strong salary saving option at $4,100. 

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Stack</h3>

## Mike Bercocivi ($5,900) / Francis Owusu ($3,700) 

Looking at potentially low owned stacks, Mike Bercovici enters consideration with three consecutive 300 yard passing outings. While inefficient (52% completion percentage), Bercovici has averaged 40 pass attempts per game in his last three contests, putting him squarely in play.

Looking at stacking partners, Francis Owusu stands out just above the minimum price with Dontez Ford now on injured reserve. Last week Owusu received 5 targets for 86 air yards on a full complement of snaps. Notably, Owusu has also played a strong red zone presence with three targets inside the 20-yard line in the past two weeks. Salt Lakes plays pass funnel defense, ranking eighth in rush yards allowed per game (76), but third in pass yards allowed per games (241).

## John Wolford ($5,800) / Richard Mullaney ($4,500) 

Getting it done a rusher in Week 7, John Wolford recorded only 19 pass attempts with Arizona rolling San Diego. This week, Wolford should rely more on his arm, putting him in play for GPP stacks. When Wolford first faced the San Antonio Commanders, he completed 19 on 33 passes for 246 yards and a pair of scores. On the year, he ranks second in pass yards with 1,401. 

Pivoting away from Rashad Ross, Richard Mullaney should provide leverage on the field in a stack with Wolford after disappointing in Week 7. Securing only 2 catches for 12 yards, Mullaney struggled due to a lack of volume, while still playing a full complement of snaps. In a prime bounce back situation against a Commanders’ secondary allowing the most passing yards per game (248), Wolford and Mullaney can be played together confidently.
