My favorite fantasy column is [Adam Levitan's Cash Game Review](https://www.draftkings.com/playbook/nfl/fantasy-football-adam-levitans-week-17-cash-game-review). [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamlevitan) is so open about his process, even when he has losing weeks, and I really admire that about him. Learning how he constructs lineups is invaluable.

In that same spirit, I will be reviewing my AAF lineups from the upstart DFS site [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com) -- currently the [only game in town](/ultimate-guide-to-aaf-fantasy) when it comes to DFS for this niche league.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Week 4 - Fanball Lineup</h3>

After [getting crushed last week](https://noextrapoints.com/fanball-week-3-lineup-review), it was a bit of a "back to the drawing board" week.

I scaled back to a more comfortable entry size, while still getting to max enter the large GPPs I wanted to target. I also went back to building lineups by hand, instead of using projections and an optimizer.

I think my player pool selection was really good in the first two weeks, so I focused on making solid plays and tactical fades instead of having thin plays in nearly every lineup.

The "punt" plays I was working with were players like Trey Williams, Sheman Badie, and Devin Lucien -- guys who still had touchdown upside, but also a non-zero floor.

One thing I wanted to do differently than last week was to take a stand on strong plays, instead of hoping I mix-and-matched the studs with the right punts.

<h3 class="aaf-header-small">My Main Slate Exposure</h3>

I built ten lineups and ended up with these exposures:

### QB Pool

- Wolford - 100%

### RB Pool

- Pressley - 80%
- Richardson - 60%
- Johnson - 50%
- Watson - 40%
- Williams - 40%
- Badie - 20%

### WR Pool

- Ross - 90%
- Johnson - 30%
- McKay - 30%
- Marshall - 20%
- Lucien - 20%
- Bundy - 10%

## My Lineups

Super tight player pool this week. I wanted full Wolford exposure at \$5700 -- probably not a great decision in hindsight, but I couldn't get off of him to play Mettenberger for essentially the same price. Mettenberger and Memphis are still in "show me" mode for me. He got a somewhat flukey rushing TD, while Wolford had a bottom 30% outcome versus a bad Atlanta defense.

I put all my eggs into the Arizona basket. Pressley at \$5000 was one of my favorite plays because the combination of Pressley and Wolford was so cheap for what should have been 75% or more of the Arizona TD equity. It was nerve-wracking watching the Sunday night game as Arizona played really poorly in what everyone thought was a "get right at home" bounce back spot.

Obviously, in hindsight, I would have liked to have more Charles Johnson over Trent Richardson -- but both had less predictable outcomes. The Snow Game in Salt Lake could have made the whole game a wash, but the game played out basically like normal after half-time. Richardson got there, but I expected him to have much more volume against a bad San Antonio defense and no one saw Brandon Ross coming off the street to siphon touches from the Iron's workhorse.

I lead the #FadeQuan charge and played zero Jaquan Gardner. Didn't like his price and I talked last week about how he was in a similar spot to Zac Stacy after his 100 yard game. I ended up with zero Nelson Spruce, as well, mostly because his $6000 tag didn't hit as nicely as Pressley or the other $4k-\$5k backs.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Week 3 Results</h3>

With such a small player pool and massive exposure to a single stack (Wolford-Ross), it was bound to be an almost binary outcome this week. Either the stack hits and I cash everything or it busts and airball.

Wolford hit Ross for a 4th quarter touchdown and it was about an $800 swing (losing $200 to winning \$600). Jhurell Pressley ended up as the RB1 and 80% exposure to him was a huge late boost for my lineups.

I had a bunch of lineups that could have taken down first place; my top scoring lineup had Branden Oliver -- who was leading the backfield touches 28:1 before getting hurt, Bouagnon came in and picked up 9 fpts worth of work (including a TD). D'Ernest Johnson did not perform in the snow and sank a few Ross/Pressley/Charles Johnson stacks.

My fades of Garret Gilbert, Gardner, Spruce, Patton, Stacy, and Pierson-El all worked out.

"When the ARI stack hits..."
