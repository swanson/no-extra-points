What a terrific opening weekend for AAF football. Exciting play across the league has caused plenty of buzz, and I’m personally excited to devour all the statistics finally available. Speculating for Week 1’s rankings was a trip through a time machine to the days before the internet would provide depth charts and projected scores, instead just trying to read between the lines of coach speak and playing detective with what little camp footage was available.

As if February fantasy football wasn’t special enough, the relatively quiet preseason coverage made for a unique Week 1 experience (mostly missing wildly with predictions). For Week 2, we warp back to the present, which of course means crunching a lot of numbers. My results are as follows:

## Quarterbacks

1. John Wolford – Arizona Hotshots
2. Garrett Gilbert – Orlando Apollos

   An easy top tier this week, Wolford and Gilbert scored gaudy totals of 41.3 and 31.58 fantasy points in Week 1. No other QB scored 14! Given the limited information we have to go from, these two are no brainer studs this week.

3. Luis Perez – Birmingham Iron
4. Philip Nelson – San Diego Fleet

   When QBs tear up a defense like Wolford and Gilbert did last week, it’s reasonable to ask ‘Was it just a weak defense?’ Find out in Week 2 by starting Perez or Nelson against the Stallions and Legends, and try and take advantage of what might be the premium QB matchups.

5. Logan Woodside – San Antonio Commanders
6. Josh Woodrum – Salt Lake Stallions
7. Christian Hackenberg – Memphis Express
8. Matt Simms – Atlanta Legends

   These four QBs round out the bottom of the rankings, with neither impressive Week 1 stats or appealing Week 2 matchups. Hackenberg and Simms could be on short leashes, as both were pulled for backups in Week 1. Woodrum is day-to-day according to Stallions reporter Chantel Buchi. And while Woodside is the only QB in this tier to turn in a Week 1 victory, the latest San Antonio depth chart lists Woodside, Marquise Williams, and Dustin Vaughan as co-starters. Avoid that situation if possible.

## Running Backs

1. Trent Richardson – Birmingham Iron
2. Jhurell Pressley – Arizona Hotshots
3. Akeem Hunt – Orlando Apollos

   Our first RB tier features three studs, each receiving 10+ carries and featured on at least 50% of snaps. All three are on teams favored to win by at least 6 points. Nothing to overthink here, these guys should be locked and loaded.

4. Ja’Quan Gardner – San Diego Fleet
5. Tarean Folston – Atlanta Legends
6. Ladarius Perkins – Birmingham Iron
7. Joel Bouagnon – Salt Lake Stallions
8. Branden Oliver – Salt Lake Stallions
9. Kenneth Farrow II – San Antonio Commanders
10. David Cobb – San Antonio Commanders
11. Zac Stacy – Memphis Express

    The middle tier of RBs features lead backs Gardner and Folston, a target hog in Perkins, and several RBBC members projected to be playing from behind this weekend. Bouagnon was 2nd among Week 1 RBs with 4 RZ carries, and Cobb led RBs with 2 RZ targets.

12. De’Veon Smith – Orlando Apollos
13. D’Ernest Johnson – Orlando Apollos
14. Matt Asiata – Salt Lake Stallions
15. Rajion Neal – Memphis Express
16. Larry Rose – Arizona Hotshots

    We wrap up RBs with your desperation plays. Rose and Asiata are TD-or-bust goal line backs with RZ carries and not much else going for them. Rajion Neal was 2nd among RBs with 5 Week 1 targets, but managed just 2.6 fantasy points with that opportunity. Smith and Johnson both managed TDs when the Apollos routed Atlanta, but neither back surpassed 6 carries + targets last week, so their production will be nearly impossible to sustain with Akeem Hunt hogging snaps.

## Wide Receivers

1. Jalin Marshall – Orlando Apollos
2. Mekale McKay – San Antonio Commanders
3. Rashad Ross – Arizona Hotshots

   These WRs put on a show in Week 1. Marshall threw a TD to none other than QB Garrett Gilbert, and caught another TD for a 20.3 pointer. McKay managed 80 yards on a league-leading 12 targets. Ross was the top wideout of the week, with 103 yards to go with 2 scores, in spite of playing just 57% of Arizona’s snaps.

4. Brian Brown – San Diego Fleet
5. Charles Johnson – Orlando Apollos
6. Seantavius Jones – Atlanta Legends
7. Quinton Patton – Birmingham Iron
8. Greg Ward Jr. – San Antonio Commanders
9. Richard Mullaney – Arizona Hotshots
10. Reece Horn – Memphis Express
11. Malachi Jones – Atlanta Legends
12. Chris Thompson – Orlando Apollos
13. Alton “Pig” Howard – Memphis Express
14. Francis Owusu – San Diego Fleet
15. Dontez Ford – San Diego Fleet
16. Ishmael Hyman – Orlando Apollos

    Every WR in our 2nd tier managed 5+ targets in Week 1, and with what little we know so far about the AAF, it’s wise to simply follow the targets until we know more. Hyman had the 2nd highest PFF grade among all WRs last week, wringing 45 yards out of just 4 targets.

17. Amba Etta-Tawo – Birmingham Iron
18. Ervin Phillips – Atlanta Legends
19. Kameron Kelly – San Diego Fleet
20. Alonzo Moore – San Antonio Commanders
21. Kayaune Ross – Memphis Express
22. Tobias Palmer – Birmingham Iron
23. Jordan Leslie – Salt Lake Stallions
24. De’Mornay Pierson-El – Salt Lake Stallions
25. Rannell Hall – Orlando Apollos

    This is WR dartboard territory. None of these WRs are primary options for their team, but they play significant snaps and get significant targets. Moore flashed big play ability on Saturday with 3 receptions for 78 yards, the only Tier 3 WR to crack double digits.

## Tight Ends

1. Gavin Escobar – San Diego Fleet

   Escobar, as in my Week 1 rankings, is in a tier of his own. Cruising to a TE-leading 66 yards on 4 receptions, he managed to break double digits without a TD. TEs that can do that are fantasy gold.

2. Braedon Bowman – Birmingham Iron
3. Anthony Denham – Salt Lake Stallions
4. Gerald Christian – Arizona Hotshots
5. Nick Truesdell – Salt Lake Stallions

   Before leaving the game early due to injury, Bowman looked to be a prime target for Luis Perez, catching 2-of-2 targets for 32 yards. Monitor his status this week. Truesdell and Denham both saw over 50% of Stallions snaps on Sunday, and both turned in 10+ fantasy points. Multiple solid options at TE from Salt Lake. Christian had the highest PFF grade and the best fantasy outing of any TE, but played just 40% of snaps for the Hotshots.

6. Thomas Duarte – Arizona Hotshots
7. Marcus Baugh – San Diego Fleet
8. Charles Standberry Jr. – Atlanta Legends
9. Cole Hunt – San Antonio Commanders
10. Scott Orndoff – Orlando Apollos

    At the bottom of the TE list, we’re into the wasteland that fantasy owners know so well. The best performance in this tier was Duarte’s 5.1 points on Sunday. Regardless, these TEs all play significant snaps and all were targeted in the passing game.

## Kickers

1. Nick Folk – Arizona Hotshots
2. Nick Novak – Birmingham Iron
3. Elliot Fry – Orlando Apollos
4. Donny Hageman – San Diego Fleet
5. Nick Rose – San Antonio Commanders
6. Younghoe Koo – Atlanta Legends
7. Kyle Bertolet – Salt Lake Stallions
8. Josh Jasper – Memphis Express
