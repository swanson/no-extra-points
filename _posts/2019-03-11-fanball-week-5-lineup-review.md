My favorite fantasy column is [Adam Levitan's Cash Game Review](https://www.draftkings.com/playbook/nfl/fantasy-football-adam-levitans-week-17-cash-game-review). [Adam](https://twitter.com/adamlevitan) is so open about his process, even when he has losing weeks, and I really admire that about him. Learning how he constructs lineups is invaluable.

In that same spirit, I will be reviewing my AAF lineups from the upstart DFS site [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com) -- currently the [only game in town](/ultimate-guide-to-aaf-fantasy) when it comes to DFS for this niche league.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Week 5 - Fanball Lineup</h3>

It was an extremely high-scoring fantasy week in the AAF. All four games hit the over and eleven players scored over 20 fantasy points (compared to just one player last week). Most weeks, you need a score in the 90s to win tournaments on Fanball. This week you need over 130 points to take down the top prizes.

At the mid-way point in the season, I think we have a pretty good idea about which players are good. There are still upsets and some of the teams have evolved in extreme ways from the start of the season (MEM and ATL especially), but there aren't many surprises at this point.

Here are the week 5 fantasy performances of players with more than 30% ownership in the main Fanball GPP:

- WR Rashad Ross (65%): WR1 (#3 overall), 25.6 fpts
- QB John Wolford (40%): QB2 (#4 overall), 24.8 fpts
- RB Zac Stacy (36%): RB2 (#8 overall), 22.6 fpts
- WR Mekale McKay (32%): WR4 (#11 overall), 20.1 fpts
- RB Trent Richardson (31%): RB5 (#17 overall), 15.8 fpts
- WR Charles Johnson (31%): WR3 (#9 overall), 22.3 fpts

Outside of Richardson busting (aside: it is crazy that he had an awful game, horrible game script and still managed 15.8 fpts and 2x his salary), all of the chalky plays hit this week.

This league would be great for grinding cash games, but the limited action on Fanball and contest sizing of 9-man double-ups makes it tough to beat the rake since it will be down to your last one/two rosters spots every week. I continued my plan from last week of max-entering the main tournaments and staying away from the double-ups.

<h3 class="aaf-header-small">My Main Slate Exposure</h3>

I built ten lineups with ended up with these exposures:

### QB Pool

- Wolford - 60%
- Mettenberger - 10%
- Murray - 10%
- Woodside - 10%
- Bercovici - 10%

Another week, another big bet on John Wolford. While not as extreme as last weeks full exposure, I thought Wolford was a great play for only \$6000. I wasn't alone in this thinking as Wolford was the highest owned QB (and second highest owned player overall) in the main GPP.

Bercovici stood out to be due to his minimum price, locked in starting role (after Nelson's injury), and his passing game attempts in his limited action. Playing at home against the pass-funneling Salt Lake Stallions, I thought Bercovici was a fine play to save salary.

### RB Pool

- Bouagnon - 70%
- Farrow - 30%
- Stacy - 30%
- Newby - 30%
- Badie - 20%
- D Johnson - 10%
- Gardner - 10%
- Folston - 10%

After Oliver went on IR during the week, I knew I wanted a big piece of BWONYO -- he lead the Stallions after Oliver hurt his groin last week and would be the main guy in scoring position. I also liked Newby to see an elevated role in what turned into one of the few two-man backfields. Between Bouagnon and Newby I had a Salt Lake RB in every one of my lineups.

There were so many good mid-priced running back this week: Farrow against a bad ARI defense after a 30 touch outing, Stacy as the flowchart play vs ATL, both of the ORL backs priced fairly, the league's rushing leader (Gardner) at a huge discount. I ended up locking onto a few WR plays and then mix-and-matching running backs to fill out my rosters.

Folston was a great tournament play as the consensus was that the ATL offense would be much, much better in Aaron Murray's first start and the confusion in the Legend's backfield keep his ownership way down. At the end of the day, he was a risk, but he was also the starter and only \$4200.

There was a ton of confusion about Orlando's backfield leading up to the game. Akeem Hunt popped off last week, but then was limited in practice early in the week. Adding to the chaos was that the team-released "Flip card" depth charts listed Hunt as the starter and he seemed to be trending up based on practices later in the week. And then an hour before the game, we find out that Hunt was inactive and D'Ernest Johnson would be making his third straight start. I wish I would have reacted more quickly and increased my Johnson exposure, but it didn't matter all that much as nearly every running back went off.

### WR Pool

- Ross - 100%
- McKay - 90%
- Johnson - 50%
- Bundy - 30% (pivot off Mullaney)
- Ward - 20%
- Lucien - 10%

Josh Huff also went on IR this week, locking in Ross as the target hog in Arizona. As Evan Silva points out, Ross is an NFL player masquerading around as an AAF prospect. Ross leads the league in touchdowns and had a plum matchup against the leaky San Antonio Commanders.

Mekale McKay was simply mispriced after a down week. At \$5100, you were getting the top WR in a game that was likely to shoot-out. McKay's targets have slipped but he's replaced volume with big plays and touchdowns -- a trade that I'm happy to make!

Ross, Johnson, and McKay are easily the best three WR in the league and there is a huge gap below that tier -- no one else in the league seems capable of putting up a two-score outing. I didn't like any of the mid-priced receivers on the slate and was happy to fill in the gaps with running backs instead.

## My Lineups

![](/images/fanball-week-5-lineups.png)

<!-- Super tight player pool this week. I wanted full Wolford exposure at \$5700 -- probably not a great decision in hindsight, but I couldn't get off of him to play Mettenberger for essentially the same price. Mettenberger and Memphis are still in "show me" mode for me. He got a somewhat flukey rushing TD, while Wolford had a bottom 30% outcome versus a bad Atlanta defense.

I put all my eggs into the Arizona basket. Pressley at \$5000 was one of my favorite plays because the combination of Pressley and Wolford was so cheap for what should have been 75% or more of the Arizona TD equity. It was nerve-wracking watching the Sunday night game as Arizona played really poorly in what everyone thought was a "get right at home" bounce back spot.

Obviously, in hindsight, I would have liked to have more Charles Johnson over Trent Richardson -- but both had less predictable outcomes. The Snow Game in Salt Lake could have made the whole game a wash, but the game played out basically like normal after half-time. Richardson got there, but I expected him to have much more volume against a bad San Antonio defense and no one saw Brandon Ross coming off the street to siphon touches from the Iron's workhorse.

I lead the #FadeQuan charge and played zero Jaquan Gardner. Didn't like his price and I talked last week about how he was in a similar spot to Zac Stacy after his 100 yard game. I ended up with zero Nelson Spruce, as well, mostly because his $6000 tag didn't hit as nicely as Pressley or the other $4k-\$5k backs. -->

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Week 3 Results</h3>

<!-- With such a small player pool and massive exposure to a single stack (Wolford-Ross), it was bound to be an almost binary outcome this week. Either the stack hits and I cash everything or it busts and airball.

Wolford hit Ross for a 4th quarter touchdown and it was about an $800 swing (losing $200 to winning \$600). Jhurell Pressley ended up as the RB1 and 80% exposure to him was a huge late boost for my lineups.

I had a bunch of lineups that could have taken down first place; my top scoring lineup had Branden Oliver -- who was leading the backfield touches 28:1 before getting hurt, Bouagnon came in and picked up 9 fpts worth of work (including a TD). D'Ernest Johnson did not perform in the snow and sank a few Ross/Pressley/Charles Johnson stacks.

My fades of Garret Gilbert, Gardner, Spruce, Patton, Stacy, and Pierson-El all worked out. -->

<h3 class="aaf-header-small">The Numbers</h3>

I was so close to shipping the main GPP this week. I was in first until the final plays of Arizona's last drive when I was overtaken by a Wolford lineup. The extra money would have been nice, but I was mostly interested in the bragging rights.

- x of 10 lineups cashed in the \$4k BIG GPP (best finish 2nd)
- 2 of 3 lineups cashed in the \$20 entry Blitz (2nd, 6th)
- 2 of 3 lineups cashed in the 3-max PFF Invitational (3rd, 9th)
- 2 of 3 lineups cashed in the \$5 entry No Huddle (3rd, 11th)

I absolutely crushed the Sunday-only slate (I played Folston in both of my line-ups). It's a much smaller prize pool but I finished 1st and 3rd with different lineups in the \$5 GPP.
