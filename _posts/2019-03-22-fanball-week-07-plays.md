The weekly **_Fanball DFS Rundown_** series covers the locks, cheap options, and high risk tournament stacks to target in this week's AAF daily fantasy contests on [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF).

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## Garrett Gilbert – Orlando ($6,800) 

Leading the AAF in passing with 1,625 yards, Garrett Gilbert remains the league’s most consistent quarterback. Adding to his impressive totals, Gilbert has notched 10 touchdowns and only 1 interception through 6 weeks. This week, Orlando faces a surging Atlanta Legends’ defense, but remains matchup proof by all accounts. Coming in as 8.5-point favorites with a 42-point over/under, Orlando and Gilbert should move the ball across the field. 

## Trent Richardson – Birmingham ($7,500)

After a few down weeks, Trent Richardson reasserted himself atop the AAF running back ranks with another dominating performance. On top of 16 carries, Richardson logged immense pass game usage with 7 catches on 12 targets. In total, the former Heisman-winner leads all backs with 91 carries, 39 targets, and 33 red zone opportunities (targets + carries). Richardson also finds himself with a juicy matchup against a Memphis defense that has allowed the most rushing yards per game to opposing offenses this season (135). Jam in Richardson again this week and take the value at wide receiver. 

## Rashad Ross – Arizona ($7,100)

Competing with only Charles Johnson for the AAF’s top receiver slot, Rashad Ross looks like a solid play again in Week 7. Last week, Ross’ 10 targets and 161 air yards equated to a league-leading 0.92 WOPR. Ross currently ranks tied for third in targets (42) and third overall in air yards (647). The former-Redskin also draws a premier matchup against a San Diego Fleet defense, who allowed the most passing yards per game over the last three weeks (312). Bringing both a ceiling and floor, Ross looks like the stud to target in Week 7. 

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## John Wolford – Arizona ($5,900) 

With San Diego allowing the most passing yards over the last three weeks, John Wolford looks primed for an eruption game. Completing 60% of his passes and throwing a league-leading 11 touchdowns, Wolford has shown upside for big games. Additionally, Wolford’s 26 carries lead all quarterbacks in the AAF, giving him a floor other quarterbacks simply do not have. On top of his efficiency and positive matchup, Wolford enters his second game with Richard Mullaney after his multi-week injury. Priced just below 6k, Wolford offers a solid salary saving option. 

## Terrell Watson – San Diego ($4,700)

With running back priced as efficiently as ever, little stands out near the minimum price. However, Terrell Watson looks slightly underpriced given his recent volume. With Bishop Sankey almost completely phased out last week, Watson out-snapped Ja’Quan Gardner 29-21. Watson also dominated snaps in the red zone (6-1), on the goal line (7-0), and on third down (11-1). Playing in the more important situations, Watson deserves a $1,000 price increase, yet comes in at the same price as Gardner. The cheapest viable running back on the board, Watson warrants cash consideration on Fanball. 

## Richard Mullaney – Arizona ($4,400) 

Returning from injury in Week 6, Richard Mullaney saw his Fanball salary only jump $1,400 despite seeing 7 targets and 71 air yards. More importantly, Mullaney ran opposite Rashad Ross as a clear starter in the Hotshots’ offense. Prior to injury, Mullaney led Arizona in red zone targets (3) and should see volume in that area going forward. Mentioned multiple times, the Hotshots draw a juicy matchup against a weak San Diego secondary, making Mullaney a near must play near the minimum price. 

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Stack</h3>

## Josh Woodrum ($5,600) / Adonis Jennings ($4,200) 

Previously one of the league’s run-heaviest teams, Salt Lake has fully embraced the pass in recent weeks. In fact, Josh Woodrum’s 85 pass attempts top the ranks over the last two weeks, allowing him to record passing totals of 380 and 243 in that span. Boasting a 64% completion percentage, Woodrum presents an intriguing option at $5,600.

Looking at stacking partners, Adonis Jennings stands out as Salt Lake’s primary deep threat. While De’Mornay Pierson-El often receives most of the attention, Jennings actually led Salt Lake in targets (8) and air yards (170) in Week 6. Pierson-El continued to work as Woodrum’s underneath target and has yet to eclipse 100 air yards in a single game, while Jennings has recorded more in air yards than Pierson-El in all but two games. Looking at the matchup, San Antonio has allowed the second-most passing yards per game (252), putting the cheap Woodrum/Jennings stack squarely in play this week. 

## Logan Woodside ($5,700) / Greg Ward Jr. ($3,800) 

In the same game, Logan Woodside remains underpriced against a pass-funnel Salt Lake defense. Allowing the least rushing yards per game (77.5), but the third-most passing yards (245.2), this game sets up nicely for the AAF’s second-leading passer (1,189 yards). San Antonio remains the run-heaviest team in the league (44.5%), but they also run the most plays (71.2 per game), creating enough opportunity for Woodside and the running backs to produce.

As for stacking partners, Greg Ward Jr. continues to fall in price despite seeing decent volume. Working as a starter opposite Mekale McKay, Ward’s 13 red zone targets easily stand out in his salary range. While Ward has yet to eclipse 25 yards in each of this past 5 games, his volume and Salt Lake’s pass-funnel tendencies set up well for the Houston-product. McKay has not practiced as of Thursday of this week and Ward would see an increase in opportunities should the Commanders top receiver be sidelined.
