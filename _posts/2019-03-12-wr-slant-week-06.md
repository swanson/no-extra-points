The **_Wide Receiver Slant_** is a weekly series that focuses on identifying offense specific roles and high volume fantasy options at the WR position.

After the AAF’s highest scoring week to date, a few offenses look highly improved due to mid-season quarterback changes. Both the quarterback changes and increased volume overall allowed four different receivers to eclipse 20 fantasy points in Week 5. Heading into Week 6, here are a few notable trends at the wide receiver position.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Alpha Status</h3>

## Mekale McKay – San Antonio (\$5,800)

What does this guy have to do to be priced above $6,000? Absurdly affordable, McKay ranks third in the AAF in targets (36), fourth in air yards (424), and third in red zone targets (9). McKay’s volume numbers could also be much larger, after the Commanders played in bad weather in Week 4 and then jumped out to a massive lead in Week 5. While McKay comes in as the fifth-highest priced receiver on the DFS slate, he remains too cheap at only $5,800.

## Quinton Patton – Birmingham (\$5,300)

A strong avoid last week, Quinton Patton enters alpha status this week, due to a changing of the guard at the quarterback position. Under Keith Price, Birmingham’s offense finally came to life with 254 passing yards. Patton has seen massive usage all season, ranking second in targets (38) and first in air yards (584). Patton has also recorded increased red zone usage, seeing 5 targets inside the 20-yard line in the last three weeks after not seeing any in the first two weeks. A positive touchdown regression candidate, fueled by immense volume, Patton should be locked into lineups this week.

## Seantavius Jones – Atlanta (\$5,200)

Another receiver benefitting from a quarterback change, Seantavius Jones continues to act as Atlanta’s primary receiver. With Aaron Murray at quarterback, the Legends have won their past two games on a combined 560 yards passing. Bouncing back from a catch-less Week 4, Jones led the Legends in targets (6) and saw the second most air yards (78) in Week 5. On the year, Jones ranks tied for fourth in targets (31) and fifth in air yards (407). With Atlanta playing some of the best football in the AAF, Jones warrants consideration in lineups across formats.

## Reece Horn – Memphis (\$5,000)

Following a similar trend, Reece Horn has seen increased efficiency with Zach Mettenberger under center, following Christian Hackenberg’s benching. Acting as the Express’ primary receiving weapon, Horn remains tied for the team lead in targets (23) and easily leads the team in air yards (313). Often considered a tier below some of the league’s top wide outs, Horn’s rising usage puts him in play at a discounted price.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Dart Throws</h3>

## Brian Tyms – Salt Lake (\$4,100)

Seemingly seeing more and more opportunity every week, Brian Tyms worked his way into the starting lineup for the Salt Lake Stallions. Last week, Tyms tied for the team lead in targets (9) and bested his teammates in air yards (96). With Branden Oliver on injured reserve, the Stallions showed an increased reliance on the pass, boosting Tyms overall volume. Hovering just above 4k, Tyms warrants consideration as a salary saving option in Week 5.

## Freddie Martino – Arizona (\$3,900)

With Josh Huff landing on injured reserve and Richard Mullaney still nursing a knee injury, former Tampa Bay Buccaneer Freddie Martino, acted as Arizona’s number two receiver. On this usage, Martino actually led the team with 7 targets and saw a healthy 61 air yards. While Martino’s big volume day only led to a scoreless, 34 yards, his usage remains important. Seeing starting wide receiver volume below \$4000, Martino also offers punt potential if Mullaney sits again.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Tread Carefully</h3>

## Jalin Marshall – Orlando (\$5,500)

Still priced up at \$5,500, Jalin Marshall remains a distant second to Charles Johnson in the Orlando offense. Despite playing starter caliber snaps, Marshall’s 20 targets actually rank third on the team behind both Johnson and Rannell Hall. Marshall has not eclipsed 30 yards receiving since Week 2, seeing 12 total targets in that span. Priced just below McKay and just above Seantavius Jones, either present stronger fantasy options over Marshall.

## Nelson Spruce – San Diego (\$6,200)

After shredding Week 3 for 50 yards and a pair of scores, Nelson Spruce has failed to reach the end zone or eclipse 50 yards in either of his last two contests. While Spruce saw 8 targets in Week 4, he actually acted as the teams third receiver, behind Dontez Ford and Brian Brown. With Brown in particular coming in much cheaper and playing more, Spruce remains a fade in this struggling San Diego offense.
