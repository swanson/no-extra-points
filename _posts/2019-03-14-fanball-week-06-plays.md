The weekly **_Fanball DFS Rundown_** series covers the locks, cheap options, and high risk tournament stacks to target in this week's AAF daily fantasy contests on [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF).

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## Aaron Murray – Atlanta (\$6,600)

After exploding for 560 passing yards in his past two games, Aaron Murray looks poised to take advantage of a San Antonio defense allowing the most passing yards per game (255.6). On top of a smooth pass game, Murray has shown a willingness to use his legs, scrambling for 54 yards on 7 carries in Week 4. San Antonio has allowed at least 200 passing yards in four of five games played this season. In what should be the highest totaled game on the slate, Murray makes sense in cash and GPP lineups.

## Kenneth Farrow – San Antonio (\$6,100)

After a quick injury scare, Kenneth Farrow looks ready for game action in Week 6 according to Commanders’ beat reporter Cole Thompson. Before the injury, Farrow tallied 12 carries for 25 yards and a score in Week 5. Notably, Farrow handled 30 carries in Week 4, showing true bell-cow potential in the San Antonio offense. Heading into Week 6, Farrow leads the AAF with 25 red zone targets and faces an Atlanta’s run-funnel defense, allowing the least passing yards per game (180.8) but the fourth-most rushing yards per game (199.2). Together, the usage and matchup put Farrow firmly into cash consideration.

## Charles Johnson – Orlando (\$8,000)

Leading the AAF in both targets (42) and receiving yards (493), Charles Johnson continued his dominance in Week 5 with 83 receiving yards and a touchdown on 6 catches. On the year Johnson ranks second in air yards (549) and first in red zone targets (10). Averaging a league-leading 98.6 receiving yards per game, Johnson has shown matchup proof ability and remains in play despite an elevated price.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## Josh Woodrum – Salt Lake (\$5,500)

After throwing 48 times for 380 yards in Week 5, Josh Woodrum’s price came in surprising low at \$5,500. Starting the year as one of the run-heaviest teams, Salt Lake’s increased reliance on the pass bodes well for Woodrum’s fantasy outlook. This week, Woodrum and the Stallions face off against a leaky Memphis Express’ defense allowing the third-most passing yards per game (229.8) With the salaries becoming tighter overall each week, Woodrum can provide just enough salary relief to jam in a few studs.

## Terrence Magee – Memphis (\$3,100)

With a lack of value options at running back this week, paying all the way down for Terrence Magee could make sense on this slate. Not only does Magee provide immense salary relief at \$3,100, but he siphoned 28% of the touches from Zac Stacy last week. On top of his 5 carries and 2 catches, Magee also stole 2 red zone touches from Stacy. With Sherman Badie landing on injured reserve, a few additional touches could open for Magee as well. While a touch match-up against a stout Salt Lake defense looms, paying down for Magee allows plenty up upward roster mobility in tournaments.

## Greg Ward Jr. – San Antonio (\$4,300)

While the injury statuses of Richard Mullaney and Amba Etta-Tawo could tilt this slate, Greg Ward, Jr. looks like a supreme value as the fourth-most expensive receiver on his own team. Despite the mispricing, Ward has seen adequate volume this season with 25 targets, 254 air yards, and 10 red zone targets. With this game featuring a healthy 40 point Vegas total (2nd highest on the week), Ward should benefit from a pass friendly approach. Still working as the number two option in the passing game, Ward remains a cheap flier in GPPs.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Stack</h3>

## Zach Mettenberger ($5,900) / Reece Horn ($5,000)

Looking to bounce back from last week’s 181-yard dud, Zach Mettenberger draws an excellent matchup against the Salt Lake pass-funnel defense. So far this season, Salt Lake has allowed the second-most passing yards per game (245.8), but the fewest rush yards per game (83.2). Completing 67% of his passes to open the season, Mettenberger should bounce back in this spot.

Looking at stacking partners in this Memphis offense, Reece Horn stand out at just \$5,000. Horn has emerged at the Express’ number one receiver in recent weeks, with a team-leading 23 targets and 313 air yards. Last week, Horn’s 4 targets and 91 air yards both led the team as well. While the big game has eluded Horn to date, the matchup looks right for a Mett-Horn explosion.
