Reminding us of the fickle nature of the league, the Atlanta Legends shocked the AAF by defeating the Arizona Hotshots 14-11 on Sunday for their first win of the season. They did it behind an invigorated offense with Aaron Murray under center. Murray was the spark the Legends had been missing and is this week’s top waiver wire add for season-long fantasy leagues.

Starter Matt Simms suffered an early hand injury that forced him out, but it’s fair to say he would have been benched in favor of Murray anyway. On the season, Simms has thrown two touchdowns to six interceptions and fumbled twice.

**Prioritize if still available:** Zach Mettenberger, Memphis

## QB Aaron Murray, Atlanta

A change at quarterback sparked the Legends to their first victory. Matt Simms entered Week 4 on the hot seat due to shaky play and things went downhill fast. He was sacked on the fifth play of the game, lost a fumble and injured his hand. He departed after throwing one pass for 33 yards and did not return. Instead, it was Murray leading the Legends by completing 20 of 33 attempts for 254 yards (7.7 YPA), no touchdowns and no interceptions. Murray also displayed dual threat athleticism, rushing seven times for 54 yards (7.7 YPC), tops among Atlanta ball carriers. He tallied 15.56 fantasy points, making him the QB2 for Week 4 and the top waiver wire add for Week 5.

## QB Alex Ross, San Diego

Ross filled in for Philip Nelson after Nelson went down with a shoulder injury in the second quarter. Ross completed 8 of 18 passes for 80 yards and a TD while adding 33 rushing yards. But he also fumbled twice and was sacked four times. Nelson has been ruled out for Saturday’s game against Salt Lake, so Ross figures to at least get the spot start. The Fleet could also turn to Week 1 starter Mike Bercovici, who was pulled after throwing two picks against San Antonio. Speaking to reporters after the game, coach Mike Martz was noncommittal on a Week 5 starter.

## Situations to Monitor

Iron QB Luis Perez has yet to throw a TD pass and lacks mobility. Keith Price and Blake Sims are waiting in the wings. Both were undrafted free agents out of college and never saw NFL game action. Price played briefly for Saskatchewan in the CFL. Sims offers rushing upside that Perez and Price lack, as he rushed 150 times for 705 yards (4.7 YPC) at Alabama.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Running Backs</h3>

**Prioritize if still available:** Trey Williams, San Antonio

## RB Brandon Ross, Birmingham

Ross made his regular season debut in fine form, rushing nine times for 64 yards (7.1 YPC) and adding one catch for two yards. He garnered more carries and outproduced workhorse lead back Trent Richardson (8-15-1), whose season YPC dropped to a depressing 2.4. Richardson remains the hammer – especially at the goal line – but Ross offers standalone upside if he can carve out a role that sees 10-plus touches per game.

## RB Taurean Folston / RB Brandon Radcliff, Atlanta

Disclaimer: the Legends backfield is a dumpster fire for fantasy purposes. It should be noted that Akrum Wadley missed Week 4 due to injury; his return further clouds this situation. Denard Robinson’s production is trending as he’s seen more work recently, too. However, both Folston and Radcliff showed up in Week 4 with Aaron Murray under center in an upgraded offense. Radcliff garnered the most carries (12) while averaging 4.0 YPC and showed off his ability by hurdling a defender mid-run. He was targeted once in his first game action of the season. Folston shined in the passing game, catching 5 of 7 targets to lead the team with 66 yards. He added five carries for 21 yards.

## Situations to Monitor

Trey Williams has 11 carries for 95 yards and a TD in his first two games and is a player to watch down the stretch. The 26-year-old runs a 4.49 40-yard dash and averaged 6.6 YPC in three seasons at Texas A&M.

Terrell Watson has seen double digit carries in all but one game, and has converted three 2-point conversions. He has yet to score a TD and a blowup game is coming soon.

After two quiet weeks Akeem Hunt resurfaced with 54 total yards and a rushing TD.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Wide Receivers</h3>

**Prioritize if still available:** Devin Lucien, Memphis / L’Damian Washington, Birmingham

## WR Dontez Ford, San Diego

Following two down weeks for Ford, he led the Fleet in targets (six) and receiving yards (71), and caught a short TD pass from Philip Nelson. He also feasted with 56 yards after the catch. For what it’s worth, Ford torched Orlando in the preseason to the tune of 11-114-1.

## Situations to Monitor

After leading the Express with 51 yards receiving and a TD in Week 3, Devin Lucien tied for the team lead in targets (5), but managed three catches for 19 yards.

Fleet receivers Brian Brown and Francis Owusu combined for zero catches on four targets.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Tight Ends</h3>

## TE Marcus Baugh, San Diego

After seeing a combined seven targets in the first three weeks, Baugh turned five targets into four receptions and a TD in Week 4. His score was a deep strike from Alex Ross, who found Baugh streaking down the right sideline. Baugh stretched out, using all of his 6’4 frame to haul in the TD.

## TE Wes Saxton, Jr., Birmingham

Catching all three of his targets, Saxton led the Iron in receiving with 54 yards. It’s his second straight week recording three catches and seeing at least three targets (he had five in Week 3), and Saxton offers a bit of upside in a positional wasteland at tight end.

## Situations to Monitor

San Antonio’s Evan Rodriguez continues to draw red zone targets, and despite his overall lack of volume has scored two 2-point conversions and one TD. Logan Woodside missed him on a 2-point conversion in Week 4. Cole Hunt was sidelined again with injury. Cam Clear emerged for two catches on three targets.
