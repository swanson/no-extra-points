The weekly **_Fanball Breakdown_** series covers the locks, cheap options, and high risk tournament stacks to target in this week's AAF daily fantasy contests on [Fanball](https://www.fanball.com/lobby/salary-cap?sport=AAF).

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Jam Em' In</h3>

## QB John Wolford – Arizona Hotshots (\$6,600)

Coming in as the most expensive quarterback on the slate, John Wolford appears worth the cost. Last week, the Wake Forest product led the AAF with 275 passing yards on 29 attempts. Wolford also added more than any other quarterback as runner, with 8 carries for 23 rushing yards. With Arizona implied for a league high 29.75 points, while tied for the second-most offensive plays last week (68), Wolford looks like a slam dunk at the quarterback position.

## RB Jhurell Pressley – Arizona Hotshots (\$6,900)

With Trent Richardson questionable due to a hamstring injury, Jhurell Pressley looks like the only bankable bell-cow back heading into Week 2. Pressley dominated work in the run game, recording 18 carries and 2 targets on 61-percent of the Hotshots’ snaps. Arizona enters this contest favored by 13-points, indicating game script should work in Pressley’s favor. Expect Pressley to come in as the highest owned this back this weekend.

## WR Mekale McKay – San Antonio Commanders (\$6,800)

The only AAF receiver to eclipse ten targets, Mekale McKay posted 5 catches for 80 receiving yards on a league-high 12 targets. Importantly, McKay saw high-value targets, including 2 in the red zone and 4 traveling more than 15-yards in the air. Also working in McKay’s favor, the Commanders ran the most offensive plays in the AAF (71) and threw a league-high 37 times. Coming in as 6-point underdogs, McKay should benefit from negative game script and a pass centric game plan.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">Value Plays</h3>

## QB Luis Perez – Birmingham Iron (\$6,000)

While 6k may not seem cheap, Luis Perez remains reasonably priced with only 4-5 quarterbacks posting serviceable numbers in Week 1. The Texas A&M Commerce-product posted an impressive 252 passing yards on 33 attempts, while rushing 6 times in Week 1. Perez and the Iron tied for the second-most plays in Week 1 (68) and now enter Week 2 as 7-point favorites. As the cheapest viable quarterback on the board, Perez warrants consideration across game formats.

## Ladarius Perkins – Birmingham – (\$4,800)

Playing 33% of Week 1’s snaps, Ladarius Perkins worked as a direct complement to Trent Richardson. With Richardson now questionable, Perkins could see a majority of Birmingham’s carries. Just last week, Perkins mixed in for 5 carries, including 2 in the red zone. Birmingham ran a league-high 13 times in the red zone last week, increasing Perkins’ touchdown expectation. Assuming Richardson sits out, Perkins would immediately become a lineup lock.

## WR Brian Brown – San Diego Fleet (\$3,000)

Hanging out at min-price, Brian Brown secured a starting receiver role in the San Diego offense after a promising Week 1. In that game Brown reeled in 5 catches for 66 yards on 7 targets. The Fleet also used Brown down the field, targeting him on 1 pass beyond 15 yards. While San Diego passed a league-low 16 times in Week 1, Brown’s role simply cannot be ignored at the stone minimum.

<h3 class="team-header aaf-header">GPP Stack</h3>

## QB Logan Woodside – ($6,100) / WR Alonzo Moore ($5,100)

Another one of the AAF’s few promising quarterbacks, Logan Woodside figures to come in under-owned with the Commanders projected to score a miniscule 19-points. In his first game action, Woodside impressed with 255 yards on 36 attempts. Noted above, one-third of those attempts went to Mekale McKay, likely driving up his ownership this coming week.

With Greg Ward Jr also carrying name recognition, Alonzo Moore remains the most likely to come in under-owned. The cheapest of the three WRs, Moore received 5 targets in Week 1, catching 3 of them for 78 yards. However, of his 5 targets, four traveled more than 15 yards down field. An under-owned, big play threat, Moore makes a sneaky stacking partner with Woodside this week.
