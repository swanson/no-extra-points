MrCulWiIV_vBdrkYTrojBDpun75X,ATL,Aaron Murray,Murray can't shake turnover bug in blowout loss,"Coming off a dazzling performance against the Express, Murray struggled to really find his groove against this impressive Commander defense. Murray threw the ball 41 times but only passed for 215 yards 1 TD and threw 3 interceptions. Murray got pulled late in the fourth quarter and we will have to see who they start next week at QB.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
Mr5k7hAZFnvFAoDhfOnpMECSCZeC,ATL,Tarean Folston,Folston saves day with receiving TD,Folston only was able to accrue 21 total yards on 9 touches but he did save his day with a receiving TD late in the first half. This was a down game for the whole Legend's offense and Folston was not immune to that but his usage remained fairly tall and will continue to be an upper echelon fantasy RB.,2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MpewpcPmXWw7dlR2o48Yu7NOKPbQ,ATL,Brandon Radcliff,Radcliff piles on garbage time points in blowout loss,"After not doing much in the first half, Radcliff was able to take checkdowns and some late game carries and put together a  respectable fantasy day. Radcliff had 6 targets and 3 of them came on one 3 play drive with Pujals in at QB. Radcliff has kind of taken the 2nd string RB role away from Robinson and should be in play going into next week.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MgXuu1IplE-oQRh9H5EBHX0Uzs_J,ATL,Seantavius Jones,Jones turns 9 targets into only 38 yards,"In what was a down day for this Atlanta offense, Jones still saw 9 targets but only turned that into a 6/38 line. Jones still saw 104 air yards and remains the #1 target on this team but he could see a decrease in production if Atlanta was to go in a different direction than Murray next week at QB.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MiIK7hSbu0NBdYcQyeRrXYckoMiR,ATL,Justin Thomas,Thomas sees a massive 143 air yards in 9 target day,"Despite posting a lackluster 4/23 line, Justin Thomas's stock is trending up after seeing 9 targets and 143 air yards, both atop the team. Thomas has been a gadget player all year but he stepped up into a bigger role this week and even saw a carry on a questionable wild cat call. Thomas is going to be an interesting option going forward.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MmuNa1g5wLa6Qj-ndC8Iav3eT1xT,ATL,Malachi Jones,The other Jones disapoints with 3/35 day,Malachi Jones saw a measley 4 targets and 41 air yards and predictably did not do much with it posting a 3/35 line. Jones has not been an extremely productive player this year but this was one of his lowest fantasy outputs and was the first game where he did not secure an redzone target.,2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MseOmwcB9ERo5Yb_5ejbYhmFxa5b,BIR,Keith Price,Price gets knocked out early in win,"After being announced the starter, Keith Price was knocked out early in the game while taking a hit trying to throw the ball downfield. Perez then proceeded to come in throw for 350 yards and 3 TDs, leading the Iron to a thrilling win. I doubt Price will start next in Memphis",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
,BIR,Luis Perez,Perez comes off the bench and balls out in nailbiting win,"Perez did not get the start but replaced an injured Keith Price early in the game and threw for 359 yards 3 TDs while adding 28 unusual yards on the ground. In the return to his home town Perez definitely impressed, posting his best fantasy output of the season by almost 20 whole points. Next week he will play a very forgiving Express pass defense",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MjiTEx33U92uj4oT_o0nS86vlwP9,BIR,Trent Richardson,Richardson racks up targets and points in win,Richardson saw a massive 12 targets which he turned into 7 receptions for 44 yards. Richardson also carried the ball 16 times for 46 yards and 1 TD. This was Richardson's most efficient games (2.9 ypc) and he had his most touches since week 2 so his stock is trending back up. With all his usage Richardson remains one of the best plays on the board at RB,2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MvmOLxRYf5EpHnnw3KboJ64aj5U8,BIR,Quinton Patton,Patton piles up targets in Perez's return,"In his best game since week 1, Quinton Patton posted an 8/53 line on 15 targets. Patton still left a lot of meat on the bone but the 8 receptions are great considering the stat lines he had been posting. Patton was definitely boosted by Perez's return to the helm and will take on the Express this week who he flamed in week 1 to the tune of 4/107",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MpyqEM1_gXIsD4IUZIqZWH4orGOo,BIR,L'Damian Washington,Washington explodes with huge 2 TD game,"After being dubbed ""the best WR on the team"" on air in week 3, Washington had disapointed up until this week. Washington busted out with a 4/128/2 line on 10 targets and a whopping 191 air yards. Perez also missed Washington on what could have been another long TD. Going forward Washington has definitely upped his status as a fantasy WR.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MkXtS_Yu0mkc3BP5bNBQeSCOTJvC,BIR,"Wes Saxton, Jr. ",Saxton is surprisingly quiet in offensive explosion,"In what was a huge day for the Iron passing offense, Saxton was only able to put up a 3/29 receiving line. A lot of his production did come with Price so maybe it should not have been surprsing to see him sputter with Perez. Saxton will look to rebound against a Memphis defense that oozes TE points.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MjnRSiLQsYyZvE5hxod1B0h_Ignj,MEM,Zach Mettenberger,Zach Mettenberger leaves game after first play with ankle injury,"Taking a sack on first offensive play of the day, Zach Mettenberger suffered an ankle injury and was quickly ruled out thereafter. Mettenberger required assistance leaving the field, before Brandon Silvers took over under center. Despite Mett's potentially serious injury, Silvers looked competent, passing for 242 yards and a score. If Mettenberger can't go, expect Silvers to start over Christian Hackenberg again in Week 7. ",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MjQz3RHcgjyoXXVYFkrbYJBL3yvn,MEM,Zac Stacy,"Stacy plods for 31 yards, but salvages day with a receiving touchdown","Bottled up for most of the game, Zac Stacy finished with 11/31 on the ground. However, he managed to save his fantasy day with 4 catches and a receiving score late in the game. Stacy continued to work ahead of Terrance Magee, but draws a touch matchup against the Iron in Week 7",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
Mv5aLcnX86bjZaa2ms87A1SdYdZd,MEM,Terrence Magee,Magee manages 10 rushing yards in change of pace role,"Despite pushing Stacy for work in previous weeks, Magee remained in his change of pace role in Week 6. Only carrying the ball five times, Magee's 10 yards were his second-lowest of the season. Just a dart throw at this point, Magee should not be relied upon in Week 7 against the Iron",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MhRTrUtStQOpZRmQASCkBgV0fhIJ,MEM,Reece Horn,Horn explodes for 8/129 in loss,"Playing as Memphis' alpha receiver, Reece Horn finally broke out for 129 yards on a team high 10 targets. Silvers locked on to Horn throughout the game and showed great chemistry with the team's young receiver. While Horn draws a touch matchup against Birmingham in Week 7, his volume keeps him in play for fantasy.",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MnFNOyNyHw3fXrcKp2lxuEu1-nwP,MEM,"Alton ""Pig"" Howard","""Pig"" Howard flops for -1 receiving yards against Salt Lake","Coming into the game tied for the team lead in targets, ""Pig"" Howard took a clear backseat to Reece Horn and Daniel Williams. Despite seeing 5 targets, Howard managed a mere 2 catches for -1 receiving yards. Playing a possession receiver type role, Howard cannot be relied on in fantasy",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MqGd44MUMsf1cWf9eclgu5gZxo_b,ORL,Garrett Gilbert,Gilbert throws first INT as ORL lands first loss,Despite the interception Garrett Gilbert passed for 269 yards and a pair of scores in comeback mode. Gilbert now has five games above 20 fantasy points and remains the top overall QB in the AAF. ,2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
MgWqgIYh39TaLl2VCdS8tsfiVWxV,ORL,D'Ernest Johnson,Johnson notches 70 total yards as ORL plays from behind,"Still working in a committe with De'Veon Smith, Johnson benefited from negative game script in this contest. Racking up four catches for 27 yards, Johnson's passing game usage keeps him in play in all game scripts. With Atlanta on deck, Johnson should remain fantasy viable in Week 7. ",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
MrcbTGRfExX6jV5TIlzBA0U5Hj2E,ORL,De'Veon Smith,De'Veon Smith grinds his way to 39 yards on 9 carries,"Playing an early down role for Orlando, game script phased Smith out of the game. His 39 yards were his fewest since Week 2, but Atlanta's poor run defense should give Smith a chance to bounce back in Week 7. ",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
Mvos-CiReB7Xgv_4M0LSY8WsAuH8,ORL,Charles Johnson,Charles Johnson targeted 11 times in loss,"Business as usual for Charles Johnson in Week 6. The star received another 11 targets and recorded 4/28/1. While Johnson didn't break the slate, his volume remains the best in the AAF. Johnson continues to work as the AAF's top overall receiver.",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
MmdTzyAXr_06YKM9MvkpiX6Pysbd,ORL,Jalin Marshall,Jalin Marshall reappears for 6/99/1,"After failing to top 30 yards each of the last thee weeks, Marshall popped up for a 99 yard performance. Marshall tied Johnson for a team-leading 11 targets, but benefitted from negative game script. Marshall remains a risky fantasy proposition, but should have big weeks in this high-powered ORL offense. ",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
MtrMUn2A9gmLtX-r9HO6AkYUy6XR,ORL,Rannell Hall,Hall disappoints with 4/24 in loss,"Working as Orlando's number-three receiver, Rannell Hall recorded 4/24/0 on 8 targets in Week 6. Similar to Jalin Marshall, Hall should pop up for more big games before the season ends, but this offense runs through Charles Johnson. Hall remains a dicey fantasy option for Week 6. ",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
Moi9AWTLwLF-WmHNRk8tzww8hRT8,ORL,Scott Orndoff,Scott Orndoff a ghost in loss,"Predictably, Scott Orndoff fell back to Earth after a breakout Week 5. Orndoff has played as Orlando's number three tight end for much of the season and failed to recorded a box score stat in Week 6. Expect much of the same going forward, unless a tight end gets injured. ",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
Mlx6Z1X5i5Av-jLpFjMD0O5wHPBX,SD,Mike Bercovici,Berc shines but can't escape turnover bug in loss.,Mike Bercovici threw for 317 yards and 3 TDs with a 9.1 ypa but his 3 turnovers really hurt the Fleet in this game. The Fleet have been pretty pass happy with Berc at the helm and this game was no different as he threw the ball 34 times with great success. Next week the Fleet play a middle of the road Hotshots secondary.,2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MkpRgd5SNWd31jHiLxntSELkwYKP,SD,Terrell Watson,Watson scores twice in breakout game,"Watson finally got some TD regression as he scored one on the ground and through the air. He probably has Dontez Ford to thank for those after Ford was dragged down inside the five, two times. Watson was also able to post a solid 55 total yards in his best fantasy game to date. Next week he faces a solid Hotshot run defense",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
Mqs-U1gQrf9_eTiz3LS8GR68hjsZ,SD,Ja'Quan Gardner,Gardner can't break slump in down performance.,"While Gardner performed better than he has in the last few weeks, he only posted a 8/19 line on the ground and a 2/33 line through the air. Gardner has failed to effectively build onto his early season breakout and has been decreasing in price week-to-week. Next week he will face a tough Arizona front 7.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
Ms7obZS7dFXxIdQMVfg1WsQJeF3y,SD,Dontez Ford,Ford leaves defense in the dust with 182 yards,Ford was about 10 yards away from completely breaking the slate as he barely missed scoring a TD on a long play multiple times. Ford still posted a 3/182/0 line on 4 targets but 122 of them came after the catch. Ford did leave the game a little banged up but if he plays his price is sure the be on the upswing next week.,2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MjQdQplRusHyVzncTteLcd_4RdB4,SD,Brian Brown,Brown lost in the shuffle,"Brian Brown (1 catch for 9 yards, 1 2pt reception) got lost in the shuffle that is the San Diego Fleet receiving committee. No Fleet receiver caught more than 3 passes, but it was a bad performance for Brown, who opened the season as a clear started but has shifted into just another member of the rotation.",2019-03-18,Matt Swanson
MtpaAkW1xD2OB6d8qJ8wyp5wSx5_,SD,Nelson Spruce,"Spruce leads team in target, but fails to produce","The Hard Knocks star lead the Fleet with eight targets, but he failed to produce on his opportunity. Spruce only hauled in 3 catches for 23 and was overshadowed by the huge play making ability of Dontez Ford. Spruce will need to try to re-capture lightning in a bottle and get on the score sheet for him to be usable in DFS.",2019-03-18,Matt Swanson
MpWMIkFb1L5PEgV4vYswWm1p0gEO,SD,Gavin Escobar,Escobar's lost season continues,"Gavin Escobar entered the season as one of the most highly touted tight ends, flashing upside and a pro-level pedigree. But Escobar has not produced for the Fleet, often times not even finishing as the top receiving tight end on his own team! Escobar had three targets, but TEs Ben Johnson (3) and Marcus Baugh (2) were also active in the passing game. Escobar will go down as one of the biggest fantasy duds on the inaugural AAF season.",2019-03-18,Matt Swanson
MnSbN3NKTWGgbhSjjM2pzQ_20YJd,SD,Marcus Baugh,Baugh on short-end of TE by committee,"Baugh put up a goose-egg for fantasy owners after coming off of 8.5 and 15.4 fantasy point games. The Fleet spread out the ball in their loss to the Iron, including targetting three different tight ends. Baugh drew the short end of the stick, failing to catch either of his two targets. Baugh did have one red zone target and he can only go up from here, but he's nothing more than a blind-faith dart throw.",2019-03-18,Matt Swanson
MiUKbbFISV5aL8sntaxSOLtUpPRE,SA,Logan Woodside,Woodside plays well as Commanders blowout Legends.,"Woodside completed 74% of his passes and averages 7.1 ypa and threw 2 TDs and a 2pt conversion. While his total numbers weren't exactly where you like them, he was not asked to do much as they scored twice on defense and once on special teams. Woodside should be a viable QB going forward.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MsQPaUeKdRzJSNKUmf9eYi6fhFDv,SA,"Kenneth Farrow, II",Farrow scores and gets banged up in win.,"Farrow ran the ball 9 times for 35 yards and a TD and 2pt conversion and caught both of his targets for only 1 yard. Ever since his week 4 explosion, Farrow has not posted too much yardage but has been piling up the TDs. Farrow has also just taken a beating and has been removed from the game due to injury in two straight weeks. Despite his injuries, Farrow remains a top fantasy RB",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
Mv1x5oSVJFjxcBN5MwJ58Fp7WOcf,SA,Trey Williams,Williams dazzles in limited touches,Williams performed very good running for 32 yards on 6 carries but ultimately was hindered by how few plays this offense ran. Williams saw the field a lot when Farrow went down and had some great runs to close out the game but also only saw 2 targets in the passing game. We will have to monitor Farrow's status going forward ,2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MpRddErY_E8R7jc9BtPv9XlGkorE,SA,Mekale McKay,McKay scores in defensive domination by the Commanders,"While the former Bearcat only caught 3 balls for 37 yards, he did score his 3rd touchdown of the season and had his highest air yard total since week 3 (77). The whole passing game did not really need to do much as the D/ST scored 3 times but McKay still managed to squeak out a usable day and should continue to be treated as a top fantasy WR play going forward.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
Mk4IH3V19RPzqhXq-wefiCcKGCg6,SA,"Greg Ward, Jr.",Ward scores but does not get the points to show for it,"Despite recording the longest punt return in the history of the AAF for a score, Ward only posted 3.3 Fpts with his 2/13 receiving line because D/ST touchdowns do not count. Ward has been a fantasy disapointment this season after not topping 6 points since his impressive week 1 display. He will return home next week to face a much more forgiving Stallion's secondary. ",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
MuzB8aju0aGjhWzwt81_5-k3bWva,SA,De'Marcus Ayers,Ayers is not needed with a 2/18 line in big win,"With the impressive performance by the defense, the whole passing game, including Ayers, was not heavily relied on in this week 6 blowout. Still though, this was Ayers lowest target output to date (3) and will struggle to remain relevant with that type of involvement. Look for him to rebound against a soft Stallions secondary next week.",2019-03-17,Jackson Conner
Mg7ESCLcQeEi-Z0oZGFiwY2--zlS,SL,Josh Woodrum,Woodrum leads Salt Lake to their second victory with 243 passing yards,"Fresh of a 380 yard performance, Woodrum doubled-down with another 243 passing yards and 2 scores. Woodrum spread the ball around in this one, completing passes to eight different receivers. Next week, Woodrum should continue his hot streak against a sieve of a San Antonio defense.",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MoIfI6pzRT6PEupCPEz5uDPNSp9E,SL,Joel Bouagnon,Bouagnon rumbles for 3.2 YPC in a Salt Lake victory ,"Showing his floor without a touchdown, Bouagnon carried 19 times for 60 yards. Salt Lake chose a pass-heavy approach despite the lead, but Bouagnon worked well-ahead of newly signed Terron Ward and Terrell Newby. Bouagnon remains one of the AAF's few feature backs and should bounce back in future weeks",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MhpQ_EdOOdPGE72Xu2X1U6pw4jKi,SL,Terrell Newby,Newby takes a backseat to Bouagnon as Salt Lake rolls Memphis,"After pushing Bouagnon for playing time in Week 6, Newby managed only 14 yards in 3 carries in Week 6. Newby also saw his pass game usage cut with only 1 target. Game script may have played a factor in Newby's reduced role, but he remains hard to trust for fantasy purposes. ",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MuShKYY0K9EeX6CMhI3AqqdV8t4e,SL,Kenny Bell,Kenny Bell flops again with 4 receiver yards,"Despite playing a majority of the team's snaps, Kenny Bell reeled in only 1 of 3 targets for 4 receiving yards. Even with Woodrum spreading the ball, Bell has fallen behind Pierson-El and both tight ends in the receiving pecking order. Bell should remain out of fantasy lineups in Week 6",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MhUElmUUm5ItoKzS_lLIuWNenhRM,SL,De'Mornay Pierson-El,Pierson-El comes back to Earth with 5/38,"Playing a role similar to Jarvis Landry, De'Mornay Pierson-El managed 5 catches for 38 yards on 6 targets. Pierson-El remains Woodrum's top wide receiver, but lacks upside in a possession receiver role. With a weak Commanders' secondary on deck, Pierson-El looks like a safe option in Week 7.",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MnZyXGX8iVvUgvjJtqLho4ON0yH6,SL,Nick Truesdell,Nick Truesdell leads Salt Lake in receiver and score in victory,"One of the AAF's few relevant tight ends, Nick Truesdell led Salt Lake in receiving with 5/67/1. With Salt Lake taking a more pass-heavy approach, Truesdell should remain fantasy relevant in upcoming weeks. ",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski

While he managed only 51 total yards, Jennings should pop up for big games in the future with Woodrum airing it out. Playing a weak Commanders' secondary in Week 7, Jennings offers big upside in this offense. ",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MkPvvbYvaVNNPxdSnPAYxFKkEa0Y,ARI,John Wolford,Wolford throws for 162 in upset victory. ,"Wolford wasn't asked to do much in this game as Arizona leaned on the ground game. Still Wolford managed 162 passing yards and recorded a pair of 2PT conversions. One of the AAF's steadiest QB's, Wolford remains a solid Week 7 option with the San Diego Fleet on deck. ",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
Mqov-trF95R18wq3KsfAxd4YinmG,ARI,Jhurell Pressley,Pressley finds end zone twice in victory,"Despite penalties nullifying a number of Pressley's touchdowns, the New Mexico product rackup up 13/57/1 with an additional receiving score. While Pressley led the backfield, he remains in a 3-man committee and could see volume siphoned by Tim Cook and Justin Stockton in future weeks.",2019-03-17,Matt Gajewski
Mm7snAx05W5tu1iKEJZ1r5GxNG-z,ARI,Rashad Ross,Ross posts 5/51 on 10 targets,"Leading the team in targets again (10), Ross could have recorded a much bigger fantasy night.
