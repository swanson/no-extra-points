Mv5aLcnX86bjZaa2ms87A1SdYdZd,MEM,Terrence Magee,Magee manages 10 rushing yards in change of pace role,"Despite pushing Stacy for work in previous weeks, Magee remained in his change of pace role in Week 6. Only carrying the ball five times, Magee's 10 yards were his second-lowest of the season. Just a dart throw at this point, Magee should not be relied upon in Week 7 against the Iron",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MhRTrUtStQOpZRmQASCkBgV0fhIJ,MEM,Reece Horn,Horn explodes for 8/129 in loss,"Playing as Memphis' alpha receiver, Reece Horn finally broke out for 129 yards on a team high 10 targets.

MgWqgIYh39TaLl2VCdS8tsfiVWxV,ORL,D'Ernest Johnson,Johnson notches 70 total yards as ORL plays from behind,"Still working in a committe with De'Veon Smith, Johnson benefited from negative game script in this contest.

MrcbTGRfExX6jV5TIlzBA0U5Hj2E,ORL,De'Veon Smith,De'Veon Smith grinds his way to 39 yards on 9 carries,"Playing an early down role for Orlando, game script phased Smith out of the game.

Marshall tied Johnson for a team-leading 11 targets, but benefitted from negative game script.

MtrMUn2A9gmLtX-r9HO6AkYUy6XR,ORL,Rannell Hall,Hall disappoints with 4/24 in loss,"Working as Orlando's number-three receiver, Rannell Hall recorded 4/24/0 on 8 targets in Week 6. Similar to Jalin Marshall, Hall should pop up for more big games before the season ends, but this offense runs through Charles Johnson. Hall remains a dicey fantasy option for Week 6.

Moi9AWTLwLF-WmHNRk8tzww8hRT8,ORL,Scott Orndoff,Scott Orndoff a ghost in loss,"Predictably, Scott Orndoff fell back to Earth after a breakout Week 5.

Salt Lake chose a pass-heavy approach despite the lead, but Bouagnon worked well-ahead of newly signed Terron Ward and Terrell Newby. Bouagnon remains one of the AAF's few feature backs and should bounce back in future weeks",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MhpQ_EdOOdPGE72Xu2X1U6pw4jKi,SL,Terrell Newby,Newby takes a backseat to Bouagnon as Salt Lake rolls Memphis,"After pushing Bouagnon for playing time in Week 6, Newby managed only 14 yards in 3 carries in Week 6.

Pierson-El remains Woodrum's top wide receiver, but lacks upside in a possession receiver role. With a weak Commanders' secondary on deck, Pierson-El looks like a safe option in Week 7.",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski

While he managed only 51 total yards, Jennings should pop up for big games in the future with Woodrum airing it out. Playing a weak Commanders' secondary in Week 7, Jennings offers big upside in this offense. ",2019-03-16,Matt Gajewski
MkPvvbYvaVNNPxdSnPAYxFKkEa0Y,ARI,John Wolford,Wolford throws for 162 in upset victory. ,"Wolford wasn't asked to do much in this game as Arizona leaned on the ground game.
