MrCulWiIV_vBdrkYTrojBDpun75X,ATL,Aaron Murray,Aaron Murray benched in ugly loss.,"Aaron Murray looked over-matched throughout most of Saturday's action, throwing for a miniscule 135 yards and two interceptions. Matt Simms came in to replace Murray and could get the start in Week 8. Overall, this Atlanta offense looks like one to avoid for fantasy purposes. ",2019-03-24,Matthew Gajewski
Mr5k7hAZFnvFAoDhfOnpMECSCZeC,ATL,Tarean Folston,Folston totals 56 yards on 8 carries and 2 catches,"With Atlanta losing by 30 points, game script worked against Tarean Folston from the start. Folston continued to split work with Brandon Radcliff in Week 6, but looked like the superior back. Expect Folston to work as Atlanta's primary back in future weeks.",2019-03-24,Matthew Gajewski
MpewpcPmXWw7dlR2o48Yu7NOKPbQ,ATL,Brandon Radcliff,Radcliff mixes in for 26 yards on 9 touches,"Working as Atlanta's 1B behind Tarean Folston, Brandon Radcliff disappointed with 26 total yards from scrimmage. Importantly, Radcliff remained involved as a pass catcher, but this Atlanta team offers few scoring opportunities and should continue to struggle in future weeks. Radcliff remains a risky proposition for fantasy football. ",2019-03-24,Matthew Gajewski
MgXuu1IplE-oQRh9H5EBHX0Uzs_J,ATL,Seantavius Jones,S. Jones busts with 1 catch for 18 yards,"Despite the negative game script, Seantavius Jones managed only 1 catch for 18 yards on 4 targets. Seantavius remained a starter for Atlanta but worked behind Malachi Jones. With Atlanta projected to trail often this season, Seantavius could pop up for big games in the future. ",2019-03-24,Matthew Gajewski
MiIK7hSbu0NBdYcQyeRrXYckoMiR,ATL,Justin Thomas,Thomas fails to make impact with 1 catch for 16 yards,"While Justin Thomas worked as a starter for Atlanta, he reeled in only 1 of 3 targets for 16 yards. Without efficient quarterback play, all Atlanta receivers will remain hard to trust going forward. Facing the Iron next week, the going could be tough for Thomas again.",2019-03-24,Matthew Gajewski
MmuNa1g5wLa6Qj-ndC8Iav3eT1xT,ATL,Malachi Jones,Malachi Jones finishes as Atlanta's lone bright spot with TD,"Malachi Jones led Atlanta in receiving with 6 catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. Aaron Murray locked onto Malachi through much of this contest, but Atlanta still failed to generate drives. Despite the impressive fantasy day, all of Atlanta's receivers remain risky plays in fantasy. ",2019-03-24,Matthew Gajewski
Mm7AJ6Byhebu0DEBXteDAaFkzjWH,BIR,Luis Perez,Perez lumbers way to alright day in loss,"After having the best game of his AAF career, Perez follows it up with 2 more passing TDs and 235 passing yards. Perez also uncharacteristically ran for 27 yards. While Perez did not lead the team to a victory, he was not the reason they lost as he did not turn the ball over once. Next week, Perez faces a tough Legends secondary.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MjiTEx33U92uj4oT_o0nS86vlwP9,BIR,Trent Richardson,Richardson scores again in loss,"Richardson finally averaged over 3 YPC as he posted a 16/56 line on the ground and scored a TD and two 2pt conversions. Seven games in and Richardson has scored in every single game and has been one of the more consistent producers in the passing game. Next week, Richardson is licking his chops to play a Legends' defense that he posted a hat-trick on earlier in the season.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MvmOLxRYf5EpHnnw3KboJ64aj5U8,BIR,Quinton Patton,Patton keeps racking up targets but no production to show for it,"Patton has continued to see double digit targets -- 10 this week -- but only turned it into 5 catches for 46 yards. This has been the story every week as Patton just continues to post gaudy target numbers but no production to show for it. Next week, he will look to turn that trend around against a good Atlanta secondary.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MpyqEM1_gXIsD4IUZIqZWH4orGOo,BIR,L'Damian Washington,Washington gets injured early in loss,"Coming off a huge week, Washington was in for a big game versus the Express but he barely missed out on a big catch early and left the game with an injury. Washington had been transitioning to the primary outside receiver so it was disappointing to not see him play a ton. He is someone whose health you should monitor going into next week.",2019-03-25,Jackson
Ml9cOZHecV3pc9mEGX4ZR4Y6ZkMB,BIR,Amba Etta-Tawo,Etta-Tawo posts 3/71 line in return from injury,"After not playing since week 1, Amba Etta-Tawo came back and retook his starting role and played well. Tawo received 4 targets and caught 3 of them for 71 yards despite only seeing 38 air yards. Looking forward, the health status of teammate L'Damian Washington will affect Tawo's opportunity next week.",2019-03-25,Jackson
Mnkh1iQb4Y5isX532bIn6EImwKO-,MEM,Brandon Silvers,Silvers battles back and leads team to comeback win,"Despite all the buzz about Johnny Manziel, Brandon Silvers put on a second half show and led the Express to an overtime victory. Silvers was pulled for Manziel at times but was the guy that coach Singletary turned to in crunch time. Silvers stood tall and delivered the game tying TD and 2pt conversion and found Daniel Williams for the game winning touchdown in overtime. Silvers will face a tall task next week against a playoff bound Apollos squad.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MmRe-7NBO9YIy6K94hDWw8-mvOXf,MEM,Johnny Manziel,Manziel makes plays in limited debut,It was a little surprising to see Manziel play as he only had one week of practice but coach Singletary trusted him enough to give him some playing time. Manziel did not play too bad either as he completed 3 of 5 passes for 48 yards and tacked on 20 rushing yards to go along with it. It remains to be seen how much Manziel will play next week against Orlando.,2019-03-25,Jackson
MjQz3RHcgjyoXXVYFkrbYJBL3yvn,MEM,Zac Stacy,Stacy continues to struggle on the ground.,"Stacy has been a very inefficient on the ground and it continued this week as he turned 13 carries into only 14 yards. Whether it is Stacy or this seemingly inept Memphis offensive line, it doesn't matter because the production is not there at all. Next week he might not have many opportunities against an explosive Orlando team.",2019-03-25,Jackson
Mv5aLcnX86bjZaa2ms87A1SdYdZd,MEM,Terrence Magee,Magee hits paydirt in thrilling win,"Magee is still not getting a ton of playing time but boy is he taking advantage of it. Magee had a really good TD run, spinning off a defender on the 1 yard line and he also made plays in the passing game. With Stacy struggling, Magee could see some additional run next week against Orlando.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MhRTrUtStQOpZRmQASCkBgV0fhIJ,MEM,Reece Horn,Horn continues dominant run with 7/113/1 line,Brandon Silvers has made stuff happen for Reece Horn after some early season struggles and now he has posted 2 straight 100 yard games. Horn came alive late in the gaming hauling in huge catches in the waning moments of the third quarter and capped it off with a huge late TD catch. Horn will remain the #1 option next week against the Apollos,2019-03-25,Jackson
Mg_iWUx6iDiql9d09kaUxijp2Qvy,MEM,Daniel Williams,Williams comes through with game winning TD catch,Daniel Williams has seemingly come out of nowhere and ran away with the #2 receiver job over the past two weeks. Williams was targeted 9 times and caught 5 of them for 30 yards including the game winning TD in overtime. Williams will continue to operate as the short yardage receiver in a presumed pass heavy game next week against the Apollos.,2019-03-25,Jackson
MnFNOyNyHw3fXrcKp2lxuEu1-nwP,MEM,"Alton ""Pig"" Howard","The ""Pig"" shows some life with 55 yard performance","After being dead for most of the season, Alton ""Pig"" Howard put together his best fantasy performance of the season with 8.5 points on 3 catches for 55 yards. With 81 air yards he should remain a threat downfield for Manziel and Silvers for the rest of the season.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MqGd44MUMsf1cWf9eclgu5gZxo_b,ORL,Garrett Gilbert,Gilbert not needed as ORL's leans on run game.,"In a game where Orlando chose to establish the run, Garrett Gilbert still managed to pass for an efficient 217 yards and a touchdown. More importantly, Gilbert completed an absurd 83% of his passes. Gilbert and the Apollos draw another cupcake matchup against the Express in Week 7. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MgWqgIYh39TaLl2VCdS8tsfiVWxV,ORL,D'Ernest Johnson,Johnson posts efficient 7/54 as the Apollos roll on,"With Orlando dominating the Legends from the start, D'Ernest Johnson rotated more frequently than usual. Despite seeing only 7 carries, Johnson managed to rack up 54 yards and a 2PT conversion. Johnson can be fired up again next week with the Express on deck.",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MrcbTGRfExX6jV5TIlzBA0U5Hj2E,ORL,De'Veon Smith,Smith dominated for 3 touchdowns and a 2PT conversion in victory.,"Used primarily in the red zone, De'Veon Smith racked up three scores in Orlando's victory. Despite the production, Smith still worked behind D'Ernest Johnson and ceded more pass game work. Smith usually requires a TD to hit value, but Orlando's offense should be scoring again next week against Memphis.",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
Mvos-CiReB7Xgv_4M0LSY8WsAuH8,ORL,Charles Johnson,Charles Johnson saves fantasy day with TD.,"In a day where Garrett Gilbert attempted only 23 passes, Charles Johnson still found a way to find the end zone on 4 catches for 31 yards. Still the league's top receiver, Johnson should have stronger fantasy outings in the near future. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MmdTzyAXr_06YKM9MvkpiX6Pysbd,ORL,Jalin Marshall,Marshall hauls in 4 catches for 26 yards in victory. ,"After exploding in Week 6, Jalin Marshall fell back to Earth in Week 7 as Orlando embraced the run. Despite the slow day, Marshall's 6 targets led the team and he remains focal point of the Apollos' offense. Marshall remains a solid option in seasonal leagues. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MtrMUn2A9gmLtX-r9HO6AkYUy6XR,ORL,Rannell Hall,Hall catches bomb but finishes with only 2 catches for 60 yards,Rannell Hall played less than normal in Week 7 with Orlando winning handily. He still showed his play-making ability with a 47-yard catch early in the third quarter. Hall remains the favorite to work as the Apollos' third receiver going forward. ,2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
Moi9AWTLwLF-WmHNRk8tzww8hRT8,ORL,Scott Orndoff,Orndoff pops up for 1/25 in win.,"Splitting time with Matt Weiser and Sean Price, Orndoff caught his lone target for 25 yards. The Orlando tight ends have split time all season, making their week-to-week situation highly volatile. Orndoff and the other tight ends remain risky on a weekly basis. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
Mlx6Z1X5i5Av-jLpFjMD0O5wHPBX,SD,Mike Bercovici,"Despite the loss, Berc throws for 300 yards again","Although the Fleet keep losing, Mike Bercovici continues to pile up 300 yard passing games and sets an AAF record along the way. Berc did struggle again with the turnover bug, throwing 2 interceptions and almost losing a fumble. It is clear though, without a reliable rushing attack, the Fleet will continue to air the ball out next week against a Pass Funnel Stallions team.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MkpRgd5SNWd31jHiLxntSELkwYKP,SD,Terrell Watson,Watson hits a paydirt in successful performance,It took a little bit but Terrell Watson has started to separate himself from the rest of the pack at RB for the Fleet. Watson scored again and posted 93 total yards including some bruising runs. It is worth noting that Gardner was removed from the game early with an injury and could possibly prevent Watson from seeing that level of work again next week.,2019-03-25,Jackson
Mqs-U1gQrf9_eTiz3LS8GR68hjsZ,SD,Ja'Quan Gardner,Gardner continues mid season skid after leaving with injury,"After only rushing for 2 yards on 3 carries, Gardner was out the rest of the game with a shoulder injury. Although it was only 3 carries, Gardner continues to struggle after some explosive runs early in the season. Even if he is back, Gardner faces a brick wall Stallion defense that held him to 0.3 YPC in week 5.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MjQdQplRusHyVzncTteLcd_4RdB4,SD,Brian Brown,Brown can't take advantage of Ford's absence with 2/26 line,"With Ford inactive there was an opportunity for Brian Brown to emerge but he just could not capitalize on it. Brown turned his 4 targets into 2 catches and 26 yards and his statline paled in comparison to to teammate Spruce's huge line. Looking forward, if Ford is still inactive next week, Brown has another huge opportunity against a Stallions defense Bercovici has already torn up.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MtpaAkW1xD2OB6d8qJ8wyp5wSx5_,SD,Nelson Spruce,Spruce goes OFF in the Ford's absence,"Playing like the #1 receiver in the absence of big play machine Dontez Ford, Spruce turned a massive 14 targets into 12 catches for 146 yards. Spruce was Berc's go to guy and made huge plays for him early and often. With only 93 air yards, Spruce won't likely near 150 yards again but should have some more quality opportunity next week against the Stallions.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MpWMIkFb1L5PEgV4vYswWm1p0gEO,SD,Gavin Escobar,Escobar sees season high 6 targets but doesn't come through,"After some early season hype Escobar really has not done anything this year. Escobar saw a season high 6 targets and 2 end zone targets but only turned that into a touchdown less catch for 10 yards. While the 6 targets is encouraging, Escobar really has not done anything to warrant serious consideration next week.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MnSbN3NKTWGgbhSjjM2pzQ_20YJd,SD,Marcus Baugh,Baugh makes great TD catch and comical mistake,Baugh almost turned an extreme highlight into a an extreme low light in the 2nd quarter when he made an amazing 38 yard TD catch but almost dropped the ball too early. This was Baugh's only catch of the day and it might be one of his last this season after he was saved by a questionable call from landing in Martz's permanent dog house.,2019-03-25,Jackson
MiUKbbFISV5aL8sntaxSOLtUpPRE,SA,Logan Woodside,Woodside struggles in victory with 164 passing yards and score.,"Despite Salt Lake showing clear pass-funnel tendencies, the Commanders allowed Logan Woodside to attempt only 19 passes. Finishing with 164 yards, Woodside played mostly efficient football. With San Antonio leaning on the run in all situations and Marquise Williams mixing into the game again, Woodside looks like a desperation only option. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MsQPaUeKdRzJSNKUmf9eYi6fhFDv,SA,"Kenneth Farrow, II",Farrow face plants for 4 yards on 8 carries,"Even with San Antonio pounding the rock, Kenneth Farrow managed only 4 yards on 8 carries against the fierce Salt Lake defense. More importantly, San Antonio decided to roll with a 4-man committee at the RB position, rendering Farrow a TD-or-bust commodity. Farrow should not be trusted against the Hotshots next week. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
Mv1x5oSVJFjxcBN5MwJ58Fp7WOcf,SA,Trey Williams,Trey Williams scored 36 yard TD on lone catch,"Trey Williams also ""led"" the Commanders in rushing with 19 yards on 6 carries. Williams has looked explosive throughout limited usage this season, but San Antonio looks incapable of committing to one runner. Williams looks likely to remain an explosive, under-utilized talent to close out the season. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MpRddErY_E8R7jc9BtPv9XlGkorE,SA,Mekale McKay,McKay makes lone catch count with TD,"With San Antonio ""establishing"" the run, Mekale McKay recorded 1 catch for 21 yards and a score on 4 targets. McKay remains one of the elite talents at the receiver position in the AAF, but suffers from poor play calling on the Commanders. McKay should work as the team's primary receiving threat against the Hotshots next week. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
Mk4IH3V19RPzqhXq-wefiCcKGCg6,SA,"Greg Ward, Jr.",Ward busts again with 1 catch for 13 yards,"One of the AAF's most disappointing players, Greg Ward has failed to eclipse 25 receiving yards since Week 1. Now with San Antonio running the ball at a league-high rate, Ward should remain as far away from fantasy lineups as possible. Even with the impressive red zone usage, Ward has failed to score a touchdown and cannot be counted on next week against the Hotshots.",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MuFzhKGMHfLzIjrXrapTwDVc1-nX,SA,Alonzo Moore,Moore records 1 catch for 14 yards in win,"Suffering through brutal play calling, Alonzo Moore failed to make an impact with 1 catch for 14 yards on 3 targets in San Antonio's Week 7 victory. Rotating receivers throughout the game, Moore's rotational role on a run-first offense looks troublesome for fantasy production. All ancillary San Antonio pass catchers should be avoided for the time being. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
Mg7ESCLcQeEi-Z0oZGFiwY2--zlS,SL,Josh Woodrum,Woodrum goes 22/35 for 229 and a score as Salt Lake falls,"One of the pass heaviest teams in recent weeks, Josh Woodrum came out of the gates firing again in Week 7. While fairly efficient, Woodrum's 229 yards failed to give the Stallions the edge. Next week, Woodrum faces a San Diego team he gashed for 380 yards in Week 5. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MoIfI6pzRT6PEupCPEz5uDPNSp9E,SL,Joel Bouagnon,"Bouagnon ""leads"" team in rushing with 35 yards on 9 carries","While Joel Bouagnon led the Stallions with 35 yards, he ceded much of the backfield work to Terrell Newby and Terron Ward. With Salt Lake taking a pass heavy approach in recent weeks, Bouagnon has become a boom-or-bust fantasy option",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MhpQ_EdOOdPGE72Xu2X1U6pw4jKi,SL,Terrell Newby,Newby contributes in passing game with 2/23/1,"Rotating three backs in Week 7, Terrell Newby landed the backfield's only touchdown. Leading the group with three targets, Newby appears to have carved out a role as the team's pass catching back. Next week, Newby will have a chance to show off his passing game chops against San Diego. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MuShKYY0K9EeX6CMhI3AqqdV8t4e,SL,Kenny Bell,Kenny Bell fails to make an impact with 0 catches.,"Playing a complimentary role for the Salt Lake Stallions, Kenny Bell failed to secure his lone target in Week 7. Woodrum has shown the ability to spread the ball each week, but Bell remains on the Stallions' ancillary targets. He will remain tough to trust in Week 8. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MhUElmUUm5ItoKzS_lLIuWNenhRM,SL,De'Mornay Pierson-El,Pierson-El notches 5 for 68 in loss. ,"Playing as Salt Lake's primary possession receiver, De'Mornay Pierson-El contributed with 5 catches for 68 yards on 8 targets. Seeing a mere 54 air yards on the week, Pierson-El continues to work as a safe, but unexciting fantasy option. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MnZyXGX8iVvUgvjJtqLho4ON0yH6,SL,Nick Truesdell,Truesdell leads Salt Lake in receiving with 4/78,"One of the league's lone playable tight ends, Nick Truesdell again recorded a productive game with 4/78 on 5 targets. Truesdell now has at least 67 yards in each of his last three games. For tight ends, Truesdell should remain a solid starter in fantasy.",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MnhMeRsiWw6LMqSeT11jQLPbC19v,SL,Adonis Jennings,Jennings flops for 18 yards on 3 targets,"After leading the Stallions in targets and air yards in Week 6, Adonis Jennings collapsed for 3 targets and 36 air yards in Week 7. Jennings still ran with the starting group and should pop up for big games in the future. As risky as they come, Jennings remains a dart throw for fantasy. ",2019-03-24,Matt Gajewski
MkPvvbYvaVNNPxdSnPAYxFKkEa0Y,ARI,John Wolford,Wolford shows out with 3 TD performance in dominating win,"After being touted as a top QB play this week by the NoExtraPoints team, Wolford came through with 2 passing TDs and broke it open with a 35 yard rushing TD in the 4th quarter. Wolford will remain a high floor high upside next week against The Commanders in a battle for the west.",2019-03-25,Jackson
Mqov-trF95R18wq3KsfAxd4YinmG,ARI,Jhurell Pressley,Pressley posts 77 total yards in win,"After his 2 TD performance last week, Pressley just had a seemingly average game where he didn't kill anyone lineup but wasn't the catalyst in winning lineups. Pressley did posted over 4 YPC again and still continues to be one of the more efficient backs in the league. With his volume going nowhere, Pressley should be locked and loaded for next week's tough battle with San Antonio",2019-03-25,Jackson
Mm7snAx05W5tu1iKEJZ1r5GxNG-z,ARI,Rashad Ross,Ross hobbles his way to 3/53,"While I applaud the effort from Rashad Ross, this guy is taking a literal beating every week. However, he continues to make plays over the middle and down the field every week. Ross should be on the field next week as Wolford's #1 target as it doesn't look anything will stop him.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MvMPK87RjthDpgkxi-5PMRJI56FG,ARI,Marquis Bundy,Bundy makes some plays in big win,"Despite Richard Mullaney coming back from injury, Marquis Bundy played like the #2 receiver for the Hotshots on sunday catching all 3 of his targets for 42 yards and even caught a 2 pt conversion. While this is probably one of the only relevant games Bundy will have it is inspiring to see him be able to produce with Mullaney on the field.",2019-03-25,Jackson
MkJMaeehojJ_G2FTn43DdskqOBtE,ARI,Richard Mullaney,Mullaneys drops a dud in second week back,"After balling out in his first game back from injury, Mullaney really took a step back this last week catching both of his targets for only 12 yards. Mullaney was still on the field a ton but just was not targeted a bunch and probably fell victim to a run friendly game script. Next week the Hotshots should need him versus the Commanders in a battle for the West.",2019-03-25,Jackson
