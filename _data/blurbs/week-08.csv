MrCulWiIV_vBdrkYTrojBDpun75X,ATL,Aaron Murray,Murray can’t lead comeback off the bench,"Matt Simms got a surprise start but had a pretty short leash and Murray entered the game in the second half. Murray did not play terrible but failed to elevate the Legends to a win, throwing a pick on what would be their last drive. It is unclear who will start next week in Memphis.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mr5k7hAZFnvFAoDhfOnpMECSCZeC,ATL,Tarean Folston,Folston bogged down by offensive woes,"Tarean Folston fell victim to a very lackluster offensive day for Atlanta and could not find a rythym on the ground. Despite getting dropped for several losses, Folston managed to accrue 51 total yards due to his incredible passing game involvement. Next week Folston faces a very tough Stallions run defense.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MpewpcPmXWw7dlR2o48Yu7NOKPbQ,ATL,Brandon Radcliff,Radcliff lost in shuffle with 6 touches,"After a few weeks of consistent passing game usage, Brandon Radcliff was non-existent in that facet of the game this past week. On the ground, Radcliff was the Legend’s best runner as he posted a 6/30/5.0 line despite the tough circumstances. Next week, Radcliff should remain the primary backup.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MgXuu1IplE-oQRh9H5EBHX0Uzs_J,ATL,Seantavius Jones,Jones continues downwards spiral.,"After only catching 1 pass last week, Senatavius Jones only caught 2 this week for 15 yards. He was a little more involved though as he saw 6 targets and a solid 91 air yards. He should be able to get back on track next week at Memphis.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MiIK7hSbu0NBdYcQyeRrXYckoMiR,ATL,Justin Thomas,Thomas is lone bright spot in win,"After bursting into the scene with 9 targets in week 6, Thomas finally hits for a 4/74 line on 5 targets. Thomas was able to make things happen after the catch and use his speed to accrue 32 YAC. Going forward, Thomas should remain a sizeable part of this offense.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MmuNa1g5wLa6Qj-ndC8Iav3eT1xT,ATL,Malachi Jones,Jones gets by with 3/48 line,"In what was an abysmal day for the Atlanta offense, Malachi Jones was lucky to get by with 7.8 fantasy points. He did see 66 air yards on 5 targets but with this offense playing like it has, Jones is going to be hard pressed to top this performance next week.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mm7AJ6Byhebu0DEBXteDAaFkzjWH,BIR,Luis Perez,Perez gets benched after early struggles,"Despite having the lead, Luis Perez was pulled in the second half due to extremely poor performance. Perez completed 10/24 passes for 65 yards for an awful 2.7 ypa and 49.3 QBR. Perez has been playing hot as of late but it looks like his job may be in a bit of trouble going forward.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MjiTEx33U92uj4oT_o0nS86vlwP9,BIR,Trent Richardson,Richardson scores only TD in win,"Despite averaging a season high 4.6 ypc, Richardson posted his lowest fantasy output of the year. His problem was that he only caught 2 of his 4 targets for -6 yards. Even with that lack of passing game involvement, it was good to see him sort of come alive on the ground. Next week, Richardson should remain the overall RB1 in fantasy versus the Apollos.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MvmOLxRYf5EpHnnw3KboJ64aj5U8,BIR,Quinton Patton,Patton is incredibly unlucky in win,"In what could’ve been a bigger day, 2 of Patton’s touchdown catches were overturned. Patton was due for some TD regression and it looked like he was finally about to get some but was just inches away. Nevertheless he did see his lowest air yard total on the season and looks to be transitioning into a lower value role. You will have to hope some of that regression hits in the next few weeks.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MpyqEM1_gXIsD4IUZIqZWH4orGOo,BIR,L'Damian Washington,Washington posts a goose egg in win,"Coming back from injury, Washington posted a 0 after he failed to catch any of his 2 targets. While this performance was a little concerning, it can probably be chalked up to the fact that the QB play this week for the Iron was downright awful. However, if Price is the QB, expect a lot less volume for Washington going forward.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MseOmwcB9ERo5Yb_5ejbYhmFxa5b,BIR,Keith Price,Price gets another shot and seals the victory ,"Despite Luis Perez recent success, coach Tim Lewis decided to make the move to Keith Price in the second half. And while he only attempted 2 passes, Keith Price was electric with the football. Price was able to make a few plays in the run game and did complete both of his passes. Price offers a little more athleticism than Perez and could be the answer again going forward.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mnkh1iQb4Y5isX532bIn6EImwKO-,MEM,Brandon Silvers,Brandon Silvers posts 269 passing yards in narrow loss,"Despite leaving the game temporarily for Johnny Manziel, Brandon Silvers put together another productive performance, passing for 269 yards and a touchdown. Silvers now has three consecutive weeks above 240 passing yards and should find himself in negative game script again next week against the Commanders. With Manziel leaving Week 8 with an injury, Silvers could provide sneaky upside in Week 9.",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MmRe-7NBO9YIy6K94hDWw8-mvOXf,MEM,Johnny Manziel,Manziel suffers potential head injury and fails to return,"After losing a touchdown to penalty, Johnny Manziel suffered a head injury on a red zone interception. Manziel struggled to leave the field on his own power and failed to return to the game. Potentially dealing with a concussion, Manziel should be considered highly questionable for Week 9. With Silvers playing well in his absense, Manziel may have played his final snaps of 2019. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MjQz3RHcgjyoXXVYFkrbYJBL3yvn,MEM,Zac Stacy,Zac Stacy leaves Week 8 with ankle injury,"With only one carry on the day, Zac Stacy finished with -1 rushing yards. Plagued by ankle injuries throughout his NFL career, Stacy landed another ankle injury in Week 8 and failed to return. Stacy has dealt with injuries throughout 2019, but found a way to play. His status should be monitored ahead of Week 9, but Stacy should be considered questionable for now. Terrence Magee and Kenny Hilliard handled RB duties in his absense. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
Mv5aLcnX86bjZaa2ms87A1SdYdZd,MEM,Terrence Magee,Magee leads Memphis in rushing with 9/39/1,"After Zac Stacy suffered a first quarter injury, Terrence Magee went on to lead Memphis in carries (9) and rushing yards (39). Magee also recorded a touchdown and 3 catches on 7 targets. If Stacy misses time, Magee looks like the favorite to lead the Memphis backfield. Active in the pass game as well, Magee draws the San Antonio Commanders in Week 9. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MhRTrUtStQOpZRmQASCkBgV0fhIJ,MEM,Reece Horn,"""Active"", Reece Horn doesn't play in Week 8","Limited in practice throughout the week, Memphis officially listed Reece Horn as active ahead of Week 8. However, Horn missed the entire game with his thigh injury. Horn practiced on a limited basis last week and should return for Week 9. With a distinct lack of reporting in the AAF, Horn remains a ricky fantasy option while banged up. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
Mg_iWUx6iDiql9d09kaUxijp2Qvy,MEM,Daniel Williams,"De facto wide receiver 1, Daniel Williams logs 5/64","With Reece Horn missing Week 8, Daniel Williams recorded 5 catches for 64 receiving yards on 9 targets. Williams' fantasy outing could have been much larger after a penalty overturned a receiving touchdown. Even with Horn healthy, Williams had carved out a role in this Memphis offense. He remains fantasy viable ahead of Week 9. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MnFNOyNyHw3fXrcKp2lxuEu1-nwP,MEM,"Alton ""Pig"" Howard","""Pig"" Howard misses Week 8 with injury","""Pig"" Howard failed to practice ahead of Week 8 with a knee injury. Ruled out early in the week, Howard did not appear close to suiting up. Moving to the team's third receiver, Howard remains a dicey fantasy proposition regardless of injury. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MqGd44MUMsf1cWf9eclgu5gZxo_b,ORL,Garrett Gilbert,Gilbert throws for 310 yards but 2 interceptions in victory,"In a surprisingly competitive game, Garrett Gilbert threw for 310 yards and 2 touchdowns, but 2 interceptions. Despite the struggles, Gilbert showed why he remains the AAF's top overall quarterback. With a playoff berth locked up, Orlando may choose to rest Gilbert in future weeks. This remains a situation to monitor. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MgWqgIYh39TaLl2VCdS8tsfiVWxV,ORL,D'Ernest Johnson,Johnson bounces back for 62 total yards and a score,"While D'Ernest Johnson split carries with De'Veon Smith, he worked as the team's clear 3rd down back. Johnson finished with 38 yards on 6 catches, in addition to his 5 carries for 24 yards. Even with the backs splitting time, this remains a situation to target for fantasy with Orlando leading the league in scoring. Fire up Johnson again next week against the San Diego Fleet. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MrcbTGRfExX6jV5TIlzBA0U5Hj2E,ORL,De'Veon Smith,De'Veon Smith scores again in tight victory,"For the second consecutive week De'Veon Smith led the Apollos in carries (10) on his way to 27 rushing yards. Despite the mediocre production, Smith found the end zone again, keeping his fantasy value afloat. While this situation has devolved into a 3-man committee, Orlando puts up enough points to keep Smith in fantasy consideration. Consider Smith touchdown-or-bust going forward.  ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
Mvos-CiReB7Xgv_4M0LSY8WsAuH8,ORL,Charles Johnson,Charles Johnson erupts for 8/135/1 in shootout with Memphis,"Charles Johnson remained Garrett Gilbert's go to option, leading the team with 12 targets. Johnson finished Week 8 with 135 yards and a score, but could have recorded an even bigger day after dropping a pair of passes. Johnson remains the top receiver option in fantasy and draws a tantalizing matchup next week against the San Diego Fleet. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MmdTzyAXr_06YKM9MvkpiX6Pysbd,ORL,Jalin Marshall,Jalin Marshall posts 3/41 in the shadow of Charles Johnson,"Despite seeing 7 targets, Jalin Marshall managed only 3 catches for 41 yards. Marshall has popped up for big weeks throughout the season, but remains the clear number two behind Charles Johnson. With the San Diego Fleet on deck, Marshall remains a riskier attachment to this high powered offense. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MtrMUn2A9gmLtX-r9HO6AkYUy6XR,ORL,Rannell Hall,"Recording only 1 catch, Rannell Hall continues to lose work","For the second consecutive week, Rannell Hall lost work in the receiving game to Donteea Dye and Ishmael Hyman. On his limited work, Hall recorded 1 catch for 7 yards on just 2 targets. It looks like the Orlando's third receiver slot has become a time share in recent weeks. Only playing complimentary snaps at this point, Rannell Hall should be avoided for fantasy purposes. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
Moi9AWTLwLF-WmHNRk8tzww8hRT8,ORL,Scott Orndoff,Scott Orndoff a ghost in victory,"Again in Week 8, Scott Orndoff disappeared completely without a catch or target. Playing in a tight end rotation, Orndoff has not been fantasy relevant for weeks. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
Mlx6Z1X5i5Av-jLpFjMD0O5wHPBX,SD,Mike Bercovici,Bercovici completes 47% of passes on his way to 210 yards,"Throwing the ball 47 times, Mike Bercovici continued his inefficiency with only 210 passing yards. The San Diego Fleet receivers offered no favors, but Bercovici added a pair of interceptions himself. Next week, the Fleet will face a much tougher opponent in the Orlando Apollos. Bercovici should be left of the bench for the time being.",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MkpRgd5SNWd31jHiLxntSELkwYKP,SD,Terrell Watson,Watson a non-factor with 0 carries and 1 target,"After leading San Diego in most rushing categories throughout the season, Terrell Watson took a complete backseat to Bishop Sankey. With Ja'Quan Gardner on injured reserve, this backfield appears Sankey's to lose. Watson remains nothing more than a dart throw for the time being. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MvqJnkN5sh8Byg8HsPF622BBTKGd,SD,Bishop Sankey,Sankey racks up 11/42 in surprising start,"Since returning to the San Diego Fleet, Bishop Sankey has quietly overtaken this backfield. Sankey out-touched Terrell Watson 12-1 and looks likely to lead this backfield to end the season. San Diego draws Orlando and Arizona to close out the season, but Sankey's projected volume should keep him in play for fantasy",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MjQdQplRusHyVzncTteLcd_4RdB4,SD,Brian Brown,Brian Brown records 3/38 on 9 targets. ,"Despite seeing 9 targets, Brian Brown managed only 3 catches for 38 yards against the Stallions. Brown still worked as a starter for the Fleet, but took a backseat to Nelson Spruce. With Bercovici locking onto Spruce, Brown looks like a mere dart throw going forward. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MtpaAkW1xD2OB6d8qJ8wyp5wSx5_,SD,Nelson Spruce,Spruce seeing 16 targets in loss,"Now up to 30 targets in the last two weeks, Nelson Spruce looks like the love viable pass catcher in this San Diego offense. Despite seeing 16 targets, Spruce managed to record only 8 catches for 79 yards. Spruce should be considered a tier below Charles Johnson and Rashad Ross, but his volume keeps him among the AAF's top wide receiver plays each week. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MluzUXObHhe2cAWPPHcb4G54tlKb,SD,Francis Owusu,Owusu disappoints again for 2/26,"Seeing elevated usage with Dontez Ford on injured reserve, Francis Owusu flopped again for 26 yards on 2 catches. Owusu worked as San Diego's number three receiver, but still saw 6 targets. Despite San Diego struggling as whole, Owusu should continue to see elevated snaps as the team's number three option. Owusu looks like a dart throw next week against Orlando. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MpWMIkFb1L5PEgV4vYswWm1p0gEO,SD,Gavin Escobar,Escobar a ghost in loss,"Gavin Escobar failed to record a target as San Diego fell to Salt Lake. Curiously, Escobar worked behind Marcus Baugh and Ben Johnson, who each recorded three catches. Locked into a tight end rotation, Gavin Escobar should remain away from fantasy lineups in Week 9.  ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MiUKbbFISV5aL8sntaxSOLtUpPRE,SA,Logan Woodside,Woodside pulled early after sloppy start,"Woodside really missed his alpha dawg receiver McKay this week as he struggled early and often posting a 4/9/32/3.6 passing line with a 14.4 QBR. The interception was really the dagger for Woodside as that is what finally convinced Riley to make the switch. Next week, we will have to wait and see who is the starter as the Commanders battle for #1 seed in the west.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MsQPaUeKdRzJSNKUmf9eYi6fhFDv,SA,"Kenneth Farrow, II",Not much running room for Farrow in the loss,"In a less than optimal gamescript all game, Kenneth Farrow struggled to be efficient on his 11 carries. He was rotated in and out a lot as HC Riley tried to mix and match players all day. Farrow did see 3 targets in the passing game, dropping 1 and catching the other 2 for 20 yards. It remains to be seen how much Farrow plays next week versus Memphis.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mv1x5oSVJFjxcBN5MwJ58Fp7WOcf,SA,Trey Williams,Williams has good game despite the loss,"Even though there was not a plethora of running room, Trey Williams always seemed to find some en route to a 7/37/5.3 line. On almost every carry he had to weave his way through the defense to find even a little crease. In the passing game, Williams caught all 3 of his targets for 6 yards. He should retain his normal scat back role next week versus Memphis.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MpRddErY_E8R7jc9BtPv9XlGkorE,SA,Mekale McKay,McKay dearly missed as offense sputters,"After getting the questionable tag two straight weeks, McKay was actually inactive this week and the team felt it. Logan Woodside struggles without McKay, leading to HC Riley adopting a more run heavy look with Williams at QB. Hopefully, for this offense’s sake, McKay is able to come back and make big plays next week.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mk4IH3V19RPzqhXq-wefiCcKGCg6,SA,"Greg Ward, Jr.",Ward unable to capitalize on McKay’s absence,"With Mekale McKay out for the game, you would have expected Ward to do a little more. Instead he 8 targets and was only able to turn that into 5 catches for 48 yards.  While he was not a terrible value, Ward failed to provide that big game that we all have been looking for. Next week, his usability will depend on if McKay misses the game again.",2019-03-30,Jackson
MupH198whtLyGoCnan_zhuBONP-0,SA,Marquise Williams,Williams makes plays but fumbles game away. ,"With Logan Woodside struggling early, Williams was able to play over half the game at QB for the Commanders. Using his athleticism, Williams was able to run for 36 yards and extend a lot of plays. Williams also performed very well on short yardage QB sneaks. Over mostly the last few drives, he also passed for 130 yards and completed 17 of 23 passes. It will be interesting to see who Mike Riley turns to next week at QB but both could prove risky plays.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mg7ESCLcQeEi-Z0oZGFiwY2--zlS,SL,Josh Woodrum,Josh Woodrum comes out flat in win,"After averaging 40 pass attempts per game in his last three contests, Josh Woodrum attempted only 32 passes for 155 yards. Salt Lake rode the run to victory in what was a sloppy game overall. Ultimately, the Stallions found a way to outlast the Fleet even with Woodrum throwing 2 interceptions. Next week the Stallions face the Atlanta Legends",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MoIfI6pzRT6PEupCPEz5uDPNSp9E,SL,Joel Bouagnon,Joel Bouagnon scores only touchdown in victory. ,"Joel Bouagnon handled 15 carries for 45 rushing yards and a score in Week 8. However, Bouagnon split backfield duties directly with Terron Ward. This backfield has turned into a 3-man rotation with Terrell Newby handling a majority of pass down work and Bouagnon and Ward splitting early down work. Bouagnon remains touchdown or bust for fantasy. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MhpQ_EdOOdPGE72Xu2X1U6pw4jKi,SL,Terrell Newby,Newby handles pass game work in victory,"Terrell Newby only carried the ball 2 times in Salt Lake's victory, but recorded 3 catches for 15 yards on 4 targets. Newby seems to have locked down Salt Lake's third down role. However, facing Atlanta's league-worst defense, Newby may struggle to find opportunities in Week 9. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MhUElmUUm5ItoKzS_lLIuWNenhRM,SL,De'Mornay Pierson-El,Pierson-El flops with 3/29 in victory,"With the Salt Lake passing game struggling as a whole, De'Mornay Pierson-El managed only 3 catches for 29 receiving yards. Locked into a possession receiver role, Pierson-El simply needs more targets to sustain any sort of fantasy production. Pierson-El remains a low-ceiling, target dependent option heading into the last two weeks of the regular season. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MnZyXGX8iVvUgvjJtqLho4ON0yH6,SL,Nick Truesdell,Nick Truesdell goes 2/14 in victory,"Splitting time with Anthony Denham, Nick Truesdell saw only 4 targets in Salt Lake's victory. Truesdell and Denham had been propped up by elevated pass attempts in recent weeks, but both showed their floor in Week 8. Unless Salt Lake returns to 40 pass attempts per game, neither looks like a good option in the final weeks of the season. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MnhMeRsiWw6LMqSeT11jQLPbC19v,SL,Adonis Jennings,Adonis Jennings busts again with 3/22,"Salt Lake's primary down-field threat, Adonis Jennings flopped again with only 3 catches and 22 receiving yards. Jennings has narrowly missed big plays multiple times throughout this season, but those opportunities seem to have dried up with Salt Lake embracing the run. As risky as they come, Jennings isn't a recommended fantasy option in Week 9. ",2019-03-30,Matt Gajewski
MkPvvbYvaVNNPxdSnPAYxFKkEa0Y,ARI,John Wolford,Wolford does enough in crucial win,"Even though he did not light up the scoreboard, Wolford was efficient and did not make mistakes which led to a sound win over a good San Antonio team. Wolford’s day was highlighted by a first quarter 58 yard TD pass to Rasheed Ross and a late 27 yard pass to Richard Mullaney. Next week the Hotshots face off against a tough Iron defense.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mqov-trF95R18wq3KsfAxd4YinmG,ARI,Jhurell Pressley,Pressley very quiet in win,"With the Hotshots only seeing 22 minutes in time of possession, Pressley’s oppurtunities were very limited. He carried the ball 6 times for 24 yards and caught 1 of his 2 targets for a single yard. With Cook continuously stealing TDs and not a lot of volume, Pressley suddenly looks like a bit more of a risky play next week versus the Iron.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mm7snAx05W5tu1iKEJZ1r5GxNG-z,ARI,Rashad Ross,Ross hauls in long bomb en route to victory,"Early in the first quarter, Ross caught a 58 yard bomb from John Wolford and that paced his fantasy day. He finished the game with 4 catches for 78 yards on 7 targets and a whopping 142 air yards. Wolford just continues to look Ross’s way downfield and next week’s matchup between him and Summers should be prime time stuff.",2019-03-30,Jackson
Mhbe28QXW-wYnR-q3KPOP8y4ydgD,ARI,Tim Cook,Cook scores twice in big win,"Despite only seeing 3 carries, Tim Cook scored twice and posted his best fantasy day of the season. In a game where the Hotshots did not run a lot of plays, Cook still made stuff happen and should be in line for a lot of work next week, especially at the goalline. ",2019-03-30,Jackson
MkJMaeehojJ_G2FTn43DdskqOBtE,ARI,Richard Mullaney,Mullaney shows up again with 5/60 line.,"Making big plays down the stretch, Mullaney’s return has really propelled this offense. Mullaney caught all 5 of his targets for 60 yards and had a huge 27 yard catch on the Hotshot’s final scoring drive. Mullaney should remain a big part of the offense next week versus the Iron.",2019-03-30,Jackson
