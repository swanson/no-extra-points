MrCulWiIV_vBdrkYTrojBDpun75X,ATL,Aaron Murray,Murray dazzles with over 300 yards as Legends edge Express,"Aaron Murray took full advantage of his first starting opportunity of the season, throwing for over 300 yards and scoring one touchdown and one passing two-point conversion. Murray out-dueled SEC rival Zach Mettenberger and spread the ball around, completing passes to eight different receivers. After a shaky start to the season, Atlanta seems to have found their franchise quarterback as they prepare to host a porous San Antonio defense next week.",2019-03-10,Matt Swanson
Mr5k7hAZFnvFAoDhfOnpMECSCZeC,ATL,Tarean Folston,Tarean Folson explodes as Legends offense soars,"Tarean Folston dominated in the Legends win vs Memphis, rushing for 83 yards and touchdown while catching 6 passes for 23 yards and another score. Folston, who struggled early in the season, took firm control of the Legends backfield. His two score, 106 yard performance was the biggest single game fantasy performance for a RB all season.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MpewpcPmXWw7dlR2o48Yu7NOKPbQ,ATL,Brandon Radcliff,Radcliff chips in solid performance off the bench,"For the second straight week, Brandon Radcliff operated as the primary backup running back. Radcliff shared the team lead in carries (11) and added three receptions on three targets. While Tarean Folston shined the brightest, Radcliff turned in a serviceable fantasy day and should continue to see around 10-12 touches a week.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
Mg_WjBJbfsSmhgblX-ChTqgx2QNj,ATL,Denard Robinson,Denard Robinson falls back to earth,"After scoring in Week 4, ""Shoelace"" had a quiet outing versus Memphis. While Tarean Folston dominated, Robinson lost six yards on his only carry and could only haul in one of three targets. Robinson had a chance to carve out a role in this injury-plagued offense, but seems to have squandered his chance with a 1.3 FPT showing.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MgXuu1IplE-oQRh9H5EBHX0Uzs_J,ATL,Seantavius Jones,Encouraging game for target hog Seantavius Jones,"Seantavius Jones has quietly been seeing a ton of volume all season, but his production was hindered by bad quarterback play and terrible efficiency. Many would be surprised to hear that Jones is 5th in the AAF in targets on the season -- only one behind touchdown scoring machine Rashad Ross. After Jones' worst game of the season (0 catches on two targets), the leading member of the Super Jones Bros had a bounceback game, posting 89 yards on 5 catches. Jones has yet to score, but it's only a matter of time if he continues to see this kind of volume in the new-look Aaron Murray-led offense.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
Mq-GmGW4EfGjMYsrlxSJKz4Rpa6d,ATL,Bug Howard,Howard contributes 59 yards in Legends victory,"Bug Howard had his best game of the season in Aaron Murray's first start, picking up 59 yards on three receptions. Murray connected with Howard on a nice catch-and-run for 31 yards early in the second quarter. It would be encouraging to see the big man get more looks in the red zone -- Howard has a mere two red zone targets on the season -- if he wants to garner serious consideration as a week-to-week playable option.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MmuNa1g5wLa6Qj-ndC8Iav3eT1xT,ATL,Malachi Jones,Super Jones Bros can't seem to get it going,"Malachi Jones had a disappointing outing -- only catching two balls for 31 in a game where Aaron Murray attempted over 40 passes. Jones is seeing a consistent 5 targets a game, but outside of his lone touchdown in week two, he has not eclipsed 10 fantasy points in a game since. Until his price drops significantly, Malachi Jones is an inferior option compared to his teammate Seantavius.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MseOmwcB9ERo5Yb_5ejbYhmFxa5b,BIR,Keith Price,Gutterball for Perez turns into a strike for Keith Price,"The Luis Perez Experiment appears to be over for the Iron. Keith Price was inserted during Birmingham's loss to Orlando and he provided an immediate spark. Unlike the heavy-footed Perez, Price looked light on his feet and attacked the Apollo defense with downfield throws. Price went 18/29 for 234 yards and the first Iron passing touchdown of the season. The Iron would be crazy to not turn to Price again as they travel to San Diego.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MjiTEx33U92uj4oT_o0nS86vlwP9,BIR,Trent Richardson,Richardson's worst game of the season still serviceable for fantasy owners,"In a game where his starting quarterback was benched, his team got off to 17-0 deficit, and he only carried the ball eight times, Trent Richardson still found a way to score. Richardson plunged in for an unsurprising 3 yard goal-line run to open scoring for the Iron and squeaked out a usable fantasy day due to his passing game involvement (4 catches, 37 yards). It was Trent's worst game of the season, but he still mustered 15.8 FPTs -- a testament to his incredible, locked-in red zone usage.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MvmOLxRYf5EpHnnw3KboJ64aj5U8,BIR,Quinton Patton,"Same old story, same bad result for Patton","Every week Quinton Patton is among the league leaders in opportunity (targets and air yards) and every week Quinton Patton has failed to produce. Patton received a massive 11 targets and 107 air yards on Saturday, but only managed to turn that into a 4 catch, 26 yard stat line. While Patton did add a 2pt reception, he remains without a touchdown on the season. There is reason to be optimistic with Keith Price under center, but Patton has yet to prove he can produce with the volume he's been given.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MpyqEM1_gXIsD4IUZIqZWH4orGOo,BIR,L'Damian Washington,Quiet day for Washington in Iron loss,"It was an unremarkable game for Washington. Despite praise from coaches the past few weeks, the production was not been there for Washington. In a game where the Iron trailed from the offset, he could only muster two catches for 32 yards on five targets. Washington has yet to score more than 10 fantasy points in a game this season.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MkXtS_Yu0mkc3BP5bNBQeSCOTJvC,BIR,"Wes Saxton, Jr. ",Saxton catches three for third game in a row,Iron TE Wes Saxton continued his streak of three receptions for the third week in a row. Saxton picked up an impressive 75 yards and was frequently targeted over the middle on key passing situations. Saxton has played well and provided stability for the Iron -- who have been bitten by the injury bug at the tight end position this year.,2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MjnRSiLQsYyZvE5hxod1B0h_Ignj,MEM,Zach Mettenberger,Mett Show is eclipsed by Murray Time,"Zach Mettenberger plunged back toward reality as the Express offense sputtered against a vulnerable Atlanta defense. One week removed from a great performance against the Fleet, Mett posted a Hackenberg-esque 9/17 completion rate for under 200 yards and a pick. While the LSU star did salvage his fantasy day with another goal-line QB sneak rushing touchdown, Mettenberger may be turning back into a pumpkin after two weeks of heightened expectations.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MjQz3RHcgjyoXXVYFkrbYJBL3yvn,MEM,Zac Stacy,"Stacy scores two, does best Trent Richardson impression","The good: Zac Stacy scored twice. The bad: Stacy ran for 3.2 yards per carry. It was a mixed bag for Stacy, who continues to depend on big plays to make or break his fantasy week. Stacy scored two early touchdowns, before doing nothing for a long stretch of the game, and then taking a screen pass for 31 yards late in the game to eclipse 20 fantasy points. More of a match-up driven play than an elite option, Stacy's outlook may be bolstered by the loss of backup RB Sherman Badie to IR on Tuesday.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MoMLwv0BMkB3spUFMbLxO_bsFEQ3,MEM,Sherman Badie,Badie goes out with a bang,"Memphis placed RB Sherman Badie on IR following their week 5 loss. Badie worked as a spark-plug change of pace complement to Zac Stacy. During the game Badie looked electric in his limited action, nearly scoring on a 50+ yard screen pass where he looked like he was playing in a video game. Badie's injury should open up more touches for Terrence Magee.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MhRTrUtStQOpZRmQASCkBgV0fhIJ,MEM,Reece Horn,Horn posts 1/29 dud,"Reece Horn is the closest thing Memphis has to a WR1 and, unfortunately, he isn't really that close. Horn did lead the team in targets -- but the volume was a measly 4. A big bodied outside WR, Horn has yet to score and remains overpriced at $5000 next week.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MnFNOyNyHw3fXrcKp2lxuEu1-nwP,MEM,"Alton ""Pig"" Howard",Pig puts up a stinker,"Pig Howard -- who has the best nickname in the AAF -- posted a dreadful 1 catch for 9 yards as the Legends beat the Express. It was a bad day all around for the Memphis pass-catchers, but this marks the second time in three weeks that Howard has only had one catch. With no volume and Zac Stacy and Zach Mettenberger getting the looks in goal-line situations, there is little upside to playing Pig.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MqGd44MUMsf1cWf9eclgu5gZxo_b,ORL,Garrett Gilbert,Gilbert continues MVP run with another great game,"What else is there to say about Garrett Gilbert? He's the best quarterback in the league on the best team in the league. Gilbert threw for two scores and added two passing 2pt conversions as the Unstoppable Force that is the Orlando Apollo offense had their way against the Iron Curtain in Birmingham. Gilbert is the surest thing to a lock in AAF fantasy, assuming you can accommodate his ballooning salary.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MgWqgIYh39TaLl2VCdS8tsfiVWxV,ORL,D'Ernest Johnson,Johnson contributes in both facets of the game with another big performance,"Doing his best Alvin Kamara impression, D'Ernest Johnson was effective on the ground (9/49) and in the air (5/73) as he lead the Orlando backfield. The only thing that Johnson could have done better was to get into the endzone. Johnson remains the starting back for Orlando and faces a porous Arizona defense next week.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MrcbTGRfExX6jV5TIlzBA0U5Hj2E,ORL,De'Veon Smith,De'Veon completes the 1-2 punch for 119,"Not to be overshadowed by teammate D'Ernest Johnson, Smith exploded for 119 yards rushing on 14 carries -- marking his first 100 yard game of the season. It's been three weeks since Smith scored a touchdown, but the bruiser continues to put up good numbers as part of the league's best 1-2 running back punch.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
Mvos-CiReB7Xgv_4M0LSY8WsAuH8,ORL,Charles Johnson,Johnson crushes despite Summers coverage,"Charles Johnson scored his second touchdown of the season on a beautify pass, beating top shutdown corner Jamar Summers. It was the third game of the season where the former Vikings receiver saw more than 10 targets and Johnson delivered, hauling in 6 passes for 83 and adding a two point conversion. Outside of Week 3, Johnson has double-digit fantasy points in every game this season and trails only Rashard Ross in fantasy points among receivers.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MmdTzyAXr_06YKM9MvkpiX6Pysbd,ORL,Jalin Marshall,Cold streak continues for Marshall,"Jalin Marshall has played well on the field, but has not been able to recapture his fantasy relevance since week two. Averaging only about 4 targets a game, the speedy WR2 for the Apollos is not seeing enough volume to justify his price tag. It's been three straight weeks with under 10 fantasy points for Marshall.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
MtrMUn2A9gmLtX-r9HO6AkYUy6XR,ORL,Rannell Hall,Hall continues steady production,"Rannel Hall again operated as the third receiver for Orlando and saw his typical 5-6 target workload. Hall is not an exciting player to roster, but he has a decent 3/30ish floor and a bit of upside as he usually sees a red zone look. With Charles Johnson tearing up the league, it's hard to see Hall putting up any crooked numbers at the moment.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
Moi9AWTLwLF-WmHNRk8tzww8hRT8,ORL,Scott Orndoff,Orndoff reappears and scores easy touchdown,"Orlando opening the scoring with a touchdown pass down the middle to TE Scott Orndorff. The big man from Pitt had his best game of the year, finishing with 3 catches for 61 yards and a score. Orndorff doubled his season totals in this one game, so be prepared for a return to normal next week.",2019-03-13,Matt Swanson
Mlx6Z1X5i5Av-jLpFjMD0O5wHPBX,SD,Mike Bercovici,Berc slings the rock all over the yard en route to his first win,"Bercovici attempted a healthy 43 passes and completed 22 of them for 304 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. This was Bercovici's first start since week 1 and it looks like he should have the job on lock as he comfortably topped the performance Alex Ross put out last week. Next week, he has an extremely tough matchup against Birmingham who is only allowing 11.7 PPG to QBs.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MkpRgd5SNWd31jHiLxntSELkwYKP,SD,Terrell Watson,Watson leads the backfield but disappoints,"Watson lead the RBs in snaps and rushing yards but he still had a down week. Watson was heating up on the ground in previous weeks but only averaged 2.8 YPC on 5 carries. The addition of Bishop Sankey to the backfield will really hurt his bottom line. Looking forward to next week, Birmingham gives up the most rushing yards to RBs.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MvqJnkN5sh8Byg8HsPF622BBTKGd,SD,Bishop Sankey,Sankey returns and muddies up the RB rotation,"A familiar face Bishop Sankey is active for the first time and gets some work in his first game. Sankey was only able to muster 20 total yards but this was his first game and expectations should not have been sky high. Still, Sankey looks to be part of the game plan and will garner some touches next week versus Birmingham",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Mqs-U1gQrf9_eTiz3LS8GR68hjsZ,SD,Ja'Quan Gardner,Gardner can not stop cold streak in highly inefficient day,"While none of the RBs really excelled against this stout Stallion's run defense, Gardner performed the worst as he only ran for 3 yards on 9 carries with a long of 3 yards. Gardner also caught all 3 of his targets for 16 yards. Gardner is still averaging 5.5 YPC on the season but has been highly inefficient as of late and his usage took a spike with the reinsertion of Sankey. Next week, this early season sensation will look to get back on track against a little easier run defense",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Ms7obZS7dFXxIdQMVfg1WsQJeF3y,SD,Dontez Ford,Ford comes up clutch with big late game grab,Ford did have 8 targets on the day but his day was made when he caught a 45 yard pass from Bercovici with 47 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter. Ford currently ranks 5th in the AAF in receiving yards and had the most air yards among any receiver in the AAF in week 5. Ford will look to continue his success in this new look pass first offense under Bercovici next week against the stout Iron pass defense.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MjQdQplRusHyVzncTteLcd_4RdB4,SD,Brian Brown,Brown posts alright numbers in offensive showcase,Brown has still yet to break out but commanded a respectable 8 targets and 81 air yards en route to a 4 rec 44 yard performance. Brown also carried the ball once for 4 yards. Brown saw some more looks as this offense relied on the pass a lot more in this one but was not able to break a big on. Brown should still see a respectable amount of targets next week against a firm Iron pass defense,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MtpaAkW1xD2OB6d8qJ8wyp5wSx5_,SD,Nelson Spruce,Spruce has an okay day as Berc spreads it around,Spruce did have 8 targets but he was only able to turn them into 4 receptions for 47 yards. Spruce's perceived value may still be a bit high as his two touchdown performance against San Antonio is still firmly ingrained in people's mind but he seems to be an intrical part of this offense. As Kam Kelly shines on defense Spruce should continue to be viable as a top WR on this team.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MpWMIkFb1L5PEgV4vYswWm1p0gEO,SD,Gavin Escobar,Escobar goes catchless despite announcer's love for him,Escobar was highly touted by the announcers and the fantasy communities as one of the best TEs in the AAF but he could not haul in any of his three targets. In a mix up it looked like he resurrected his day with a late score but it was in fact another TE Ben Johnson. TE remains very up and down and despite the down week Escobar remains among the best at his position.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MnSbN3NKTWGgbhSjjM2pzQ_20YJd,SD,Marcus Baugh,Baugh stretches field and makes some huge catches.,Despite being the lesser known TE on the fleet Baugh has been very productive as of late. Baugh caught 2 of his 4 targets for 65 yards and was second among TEs in air yards with 56. Baugh is hard to miss out there with his flashy plays down the seam and he has definitely caught his coaching staff's attention. Going into next week Baugh still looks to have a stranglehold on some valuable targets in Martz's high-powered offense.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MiUKbbFISV5aL8sntaxSOLtUpPRE,SA,Logan Woodside,Woodside rides hot start to lead upset over hotshots,Woodside started out strong completed 8 of his first 9 passes for 150 yards and 54 yard TD pass to McKay. Woodside ended up with 290 yards 2 TDs and 1 int after a little less production in the second half. Woodside also added 13 yards and a 2 point conversion on the ground. It looks like Woodside has silenced all who were calling for Marquise and has once again taken full control of the QB1 position. Next week he faces a quietly stingy Legends pass defense.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MsQPaUeKdRzJSNKUmf9eYi6fhFDv,SA,"Kenneth Farrow, II",Farrow produces solid fantasy day despite late injury,Farrow did not do much on the ground but he hit paydirt and caught a 43 yard screen pass in the 4th quarter which really bolstered his day. Farrow also suffered an undisclosed arm injury which looked to some as a dislocated shoulder. Farrow's injury should be monitored closely as he has a cake matchup next week versus the legends.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Mv1x5oSVJFjxcBN5MwJ58Fp7WOcf,SA,Trey Williams,"Williams jukes, spins, and stumbles his way to a mediocre fantasy day","Trey Williams probably forced more missed tackles per touch than any other running back this week but his offensive line did not do him any favors. Williams ran 10 times for only 22 yards and caught his only target for 8 yards. Williams also stumbled as he was about to score a TD in his second consecutive week. While Williams looks amazing on the field, the yardage numbers have not been there over the last two weeks but he should see a big boost if Farrow is to miss time.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MpRddErY_E8R7jc9BtPv9XlGkorE,SA,Mekale McKay,Big Play McKay hauls in another long bomb TD,McKay caught all 5 of his targets for 91 yards and that included a long 54 yard dime from Woodside in the Commander's first drive of the game. McKay is currently third in the league in receiving yards and air yards which means he will continue to produce as a top end receiver. Going into next week he remains Woodside's top target despite the worst matchup for WRs in the league,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Mk4IH3V19RPzqhXq-wefiCcKGCg6,SA,"Greg Ward, Jr.",Ward's stock continues to plummet after 18 yard day,"Since week 1, Greg Ward has really not done anything noteworthy at all. He is basically a manufactured touch player and is only getting 3-5 of them a game. This week he caught 2 of his three targets for 15 yards and got 3 yards on his only carry. Next week, Ward as a really bad matchup against the top pass defense in Atlanta",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MuzB8aju0aGjhWzwt81_5-k3bWva,SA,De'Marcus Ayers,Ayers produces as Woodside's number 2 option,Ayers has still failed to match his week 2 explosion but he still posted a fairly solid day catching 4 of his 5 targets for 50 yards. It seems as Ayers has passed up Ward and looks to be the #2 option for the commanders in the passing game. Ayers looks to be locked in to 4-6 targets but his efficiency will be tested this week against the Legends,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Mg7ESCLcQeEi-Z0oZGFiwY2--zlS,SL,Josh Woodrum,Erickson lets Woodrum free in crushing loss to the Fleet,"Woodrum has played a sort of game manager esque role for the Stallions in past weeks but with Oliver out, Woodrum passed the ball a mammoth 48 times. Woodrum averaged almost 8 ypa but had 3 interceptions to go along with his 2 2pt conversions and a late game passing touchdown. This was a wild game and Woodrum probably won't near 50 passing attempts again but as long as Oliver is out Woodrum should be in line for some serious volume.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MoIfI6pzRT6PEupCPEz5uDPNSp9E,SL,Joel Bouagnon,Bouagnon salvages day with 2 TDs,The first week of this Oliver-less backfield did not go exactly as planned for Bouagnon's yardage totals but he still had a good fantasy day on the back of his two touchdowns. Bouagnon posted 11 carries for 36 yards and caught both of his targets for 6 yards. Bouagnon will look to repeat his Trent Richardson esque performance against the Memphis defense who is giving up a lot of fantasy points to RBs,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MhpQ_EdOOdPGE72Xu2X1U6pw4jKi,SL,Terrell Newby,Newby takes hold of pass catching role before injury,Newby took the role created by Oliver's absence and ran with it. Newby caught 4 of his 5 targets for 33 yards but was not able to get much going on the ground with only 2 rushing yards. Newby left some meat on the bone as he left the game early from injury plus he had some chunk plays called back due to penalty. We will have to monitor Newbys injury report this week to see his availability for next week.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MuShKYY0K9EeX6CMhI3AqqdV8t4e,SL,Kenny Bell,Bell comes up clutch with huge 2 point conversion catch,In past weeks Bell had lots of air yards but this week his only had 21. He did catch 3 of his 5 targets for 22 yards and came up with a big 2pt reception late in the fourth quarter. With Woodrum throwing for 380 yards it would have been nice to see Bell gets a little more than 22 yards but he will look to rebound next week against a strong Memphis secondary.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MhUElmUUm5ItoKzS_lLIuWNenhRM,SL,De'Mornay Pierson-El,Pierson-El shows out with 130 yard explosion.,"Pierson-El came back alive this week with a huge 8 catch 130 yard performance on 9 targets. Earlier in the year, Pierson-El was very inefficient with his targets but he has since upped his efficiency by a lot and became Woodrum's definitive favorite target. As opposed to week 3, his air yards were there this week as well with 91. He will look to continue this surge next week against the Express.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MnZyXGX8iVvUgvjJtqLho4ON0yH6,SL,Nick Truesdell,Truesdell establishes himself as a top TE,"With a lot of the early season TE hype going to Anthony Denham, Truesdell caught all 6 of his targets for 71 yards and a TD. He posted the best TE score of the week and one of the best of the season. His late game touchdown was also almost a game clincher before the Fleet stormed back down the field. Going into next week, Memphis gives up the most points to TEs in the league.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MnhMeRsiWw6LMqSeT11jQLPbC19v,SL,Adonis Jennings,Jennings comes up with huge 4th quarter catch despite loss,Jennings caught a long 42 yard reception late in the game but that was about it for him. He caught 1 of his 4 other targets for 5 yards. He did see 70+ air yards which is encouraging and solidifies him as one of the top receivers on this suddenly pass first team. Next week he will try and build on this performance against a stout Memphis secondary,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MkPvvbYvaVNNPxdSnPAYxFKkEa0Y,ARI,John Wolford,Wolford musters useable fantasy day despite shaky start,"Wolford started off the game with 3 picks in the first half, although most of them came off tipped passes. Wolford did rebound in the second half though as he slung the ball all over the field. He hit Ross for a 45 yard TD and Duarte for a 4 yard TD late in the game and also passed and ran for a 2pt conversion. Wolford has not quite found his week 1 form but has put together some decent fantasy performances. He is in a pretty good matchup next week in a presumed pass friendly script",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Mqov-trF95R18wq3KsfAxd4YinmG,ARI,Jhurell Pressley,Pressley disappointed as he is scripted out.,Pressley did not have a lot go his way in this game as he only had 8 carries on the ground and only caught 2 of his 4 targets for 17 yards. The hotshots were beat in all facets of the game in the first half and that left Pressley with not a lot of volume on the ground and his only hope was to break a big run and he cold not. Pressley will probably be in a similar situation this week when the Hotshots take on the high flying Apollos offense.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
Mm7snAx05W5tu1iKEJZ1r5GxNG-z,ARI,Rashad Ross,Ross catches bombs and takes shots on his way to another top fantasy performance.,Rashad Ross is becoming an AAF wonder has he posts another day with 100+ yards and a TD which also included a huge 45 yard TD reception that ignited the offense and a huge 2 pt conversion reception late in the game. Ross also led the team down the field late in the game by drawing huge pass interference calls. Ross looks to be in line for a lot of the same targets in what should be a shootout next week in Orlando.,2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
MvMPK87RjthDpgkxi-5PMRJI56FG,ARI,Marquis Bundy,Bundy thrust into action amongst all the injuries. ,"With Huff going on the IR and Mullaney still being out Bundy was in line for 6 targets by default. He caught 3 of those for 49 yards and shared time with Freddie Martino as the WR2 behind Rocket Ross. With Mullaney possibly coming back soon, Bundy needs to take advantage of his playing time next week in a presumed pass heavy game script.",2019-03-11,Jackson Conner
